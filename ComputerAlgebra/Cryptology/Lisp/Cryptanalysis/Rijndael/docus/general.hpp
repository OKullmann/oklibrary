  \brief User documentation for the Maxima computer algebra system implementation of the AES constraint translations.


  \todo General structure
  <ul>
   <li> The purpose of this module is to offer a collection of
   translations of the Advanced encryption standard and variants
   there of into CNF SAT systems, constraint systems and so on. </li>
   <li> For information on the AES-specific translation components, see
   ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/docus/Translations.hpp.
   </li>
   <li> For information on the general translation framework, see
   ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/docus/ConstraintTemplateRewriteSystem.hpp.
   </li>
   <li> For experimental results for the AES translations, see
   Investigations/Cryptography/AdvancedEncryptionStandard/plans/general.hpp.
