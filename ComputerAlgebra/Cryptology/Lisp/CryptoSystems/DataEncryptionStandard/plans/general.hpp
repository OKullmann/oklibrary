  \brief Plans for the Data Encryption Standard crypto-system in Maxima/Lisp


  \bug Test failure with okltest_des_round_keys_template
  <ul>
   <li>
   \verbatim
okltest_des_round_keys_template(des_round_keys_template)
"Too many" arguments supplied to assert(expr); found: errexp1
   \endverbatim
   </li>
  </ul>


  \bug Bad state of milestones
  <ul>
   <li> A milestone 0.0.1 means that nothing is there --- however the whole
   system was there! </li>
   <li> There are plenty of editorial errors. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Improve key schedule tests
  <ul>
   <li> We should look for tests vectors for the DES key schedule.
   </li>
   <li> These test vectors should then be added to the tests. </li>
   <li> The test vectors should provide good test coverage. </li>
   <li> Before we can properly test the function, we need a specification
   (see "Specification"). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Specification
  <ul>
   <li> We need full specifications for the following functions:
   <ul>
    <li> des_round_keys. </li>
    <li> des_encryption. </li>
    <li> des_decryption. </li>
    <li> des_template. </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Add variants with reduced number of rounds
  <ul>
   <li> In the literature, such as [Logical cryptanalysis as a SAT problem;
   Massaci and Marraro], variants of DES with smaller numbers of rounds are
   considered. </li>
   <li> Do variants of the DES with smaller numbers of rounds flip the two
   32-bit outputs? <ul>
    <li> It makes sense to do so. Then applying the cipher with the reversed
    round key list gives the decryption algorithm. This is the same as with
    16-round DES. </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li> To be able to properly test this, we need test vectors for
   smaller variants; see "Find more test vectors". </li>
   <li> All functions which can have a variant with a reduced number of rounds
   should have one. For example, des_encryption_hex should have
   des_encryption_reduced_hex. </li>
   <li> DONE We should have a clear simple function for the full DES.
   Therefore, it is best to have a different function for the smaller
   variants. For instance "des_encryption_reduced". </li>
   <li> DONE With the current system, this is as simple as:
   \verbatim
des_encryption_reduced(plaintext, key, r) :=
 des_template(plaintext, take_elements(r,des_round_keys(key)))$
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> DONE We should offer generalised versions of the current functions.
   </li>
   <li> DONE These generalised functions should take the number r of rounds.
   </li>
   <li> DONE The functions should then compute the DES encryption with r
   rounds on the other inputs. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Find more test vectors
  <ul>
   <li> We need test vectors for variants of DES with smaller numbers of
   rounds. </li>
   <li> Full 16 round DES swaps the two 32-bit outputs. Do DES variants
   with less rounds do this? </li>
   <li> Authorative test vectors should answer this question. </li>
   <li> [NIST Special Publication 800-17; NIST] provides test vectors for
   the full DES, and a small set of vectors for DES "round outputs". </li>
   <li> In this case "round outputs" means the output of each round in
   the *16-round* DES computation. That is, these are not (directly) test
   vectors for generalised m-round DES. </li>
   <li> These test vectors should be moved into the library. </li>
   <li> Test vectors are also needed for the generalised m-round DES. </li>
   <li> The tests should then be extended. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Notion of DES round
  <ul>
   <li> We consider the DES round function where:
   <ul>
    <li> It takes two 32-bit inputs (previous and current) and a 48-bit round
    key. </li>
    <li> The first 32-bit input, "previous", is the output of the
    round two rounds ago. </li>
    <li> The second 32-bit input, "current", is the output of the previous
    round. </li>
    <li> For the first round, previous is the first 32-bits and
    current is the second 32-bits of the 64-bit DES input. </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li> The round function does the following:
   <ul>
    <li> Applies an "expansion map" to current. This rearranges and repeats
    some bits to make 48-bits. </li>
    <li> Adds the result of the expansion to the 48-bit key. </li>
    <li> Applies DES Sbox i, for i in {1,...,6}, to the i-th 6-bit block
    in the result. This yields 32-bits, as the Sboxes are 6-to-4 bit
    functions. </li>
    <li> Applies a "permutation box", i.e., a rewiring of bits, to the
    32-bit result of the Sbox operations. </li>
    <li> Adds previous to the result of the "permutation box". </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li> Can the DES encryption scheme be fit into the notion of an
   iterated block cipher (see
   ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/CryptoSystems/IteratedBlockCipher.mac)?
   </li>
   <li> Can the DES key addition be moved to the beginning of the round? This
   would then fit with our description of AES. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Links
  <ul>
   <li> For cryptanalysis functions for the DES see
   ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/DataEncryptionStandard/plans/general.hpp.
   </li>
   <li> For investigations see
   Experimentation/Investigations/Cryptography/DataEncryptionStandard/plans/general.hpp.
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Triple-DES
  <ul>
   <li> We should provide functions and tests for the Triple-DES encryption
   scheme. </li>
   <li> Triple-DES is also called "3DES". </li>
   <li> Triple-DES is defined in
   http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-67/SP800-67.pdf . </li>
   <li> Triple-DES was apparently first defined in ANS X9.52-1998.
   Is this available somewhere? </li>
   <li> Triple-DES is defined as:
   \verbatim
triple_des_hex(P,K1,K2,K3) := des_encryption_hex(des_decryption_hex(des_encryption_hex(P,K1),K2),K3);
   \endverbatim
   where K1, K2 and K3 are 64-bit keys with 56-bit of actual key data and
   8 parity bits. </li>
   <li> K1, K2 and K3 can be used in 3 ways, as defined by the Triple-DES
   standard:
    <ol>
     <li> All keys are independent (164 independent key-bits). </li>
     <li> K1 and K2 are independent but K1=K3 (112 independent key-bits). </li>
     <li> K1 = K2 = K3 (56 independent key-bits; this is exactly DES). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Do we consider 3 different keys, or take a single key which we then
   split into the 3 keys?
    <ul>
     <li> Taking a single key fits more with our notion of a cipher, as
     something that takes a plaintext and key and outputs a ciphertextt.
     </li>
     <li> Taking 3 keys fits more naturally with the definition of
     Triple-DES and ensures we always know which key is which. </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> Test vectors are available at
   http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/index.html in
   http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-20/800-20.pdf . </li>
   <li> Triple-DES is used in the various payment card systems world-wide.
   See http://www.eftpos.co.nz/cms_display.php?sn=55&st=1&pg=4261 . </li>
   <li> 112-bit Triple-DES should be compared to 128-bit AES. </li>
  </ul>
