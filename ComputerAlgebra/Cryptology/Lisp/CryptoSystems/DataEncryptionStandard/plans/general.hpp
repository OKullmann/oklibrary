  \brief Plans for the Data Encryption Standard crypto-system in Maxima/Lisp


  \todo Add todos


  \todo Find more test vectors
  <ul>
   <li> For the tests of the DES cipher, we should have a wide range
   of test vectors to ensure we match the standard. </li>
   <li> This becomes especially important when we consider reduced round
   variants. </li>
  </ul>
