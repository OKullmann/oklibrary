  \brief Plans for the KeeLoq crypto-system in Maxima/Lisp


  \todo Test vectors
  <ul>
   <li> We need test vectors for the testing of the KeeLoq implementation.
   </li>
   <li> Test vectors are not provided in
   [Algebraic and Slide attacks on KeeLoq; Gregory Bard, Nicholas Courtois and
   David Wagner], and the KeeLoq specification documents referenced do
   not provide them either. </li>
   <li> [A Practical Attack on KeeLoq; Aerts, Biham, De Moitié, Mulder,
   Dunkelman, Indesteege, Keller, Preneel, Vandenbosch, Verbauwhede] mentions
   the computation of test vectors from a circuit implementation of KeeLoq.
   </li>
   <li> MG has e-mailed Eli Biham asking for these test vectors. </li>
   <li> There is a C implementation of KeeLoq at
   http://cryptolib.com/ciphers/keeloq/KeeLoq.c, and so test vectors could be
   derived from this, however, the correctness of this implementation isn't
   clear. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Add todos


  \todo Create milestones
