  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  \par Version history
   - 0.0.6 : 7.3.2008; initial version number (basic implementation of AES completed with tests, and settling of module structure).
   - 0.0.7 : 15.3.2008; some bugs in tests fixed, as well as sbox lookup data added and integrated with AES implementation.
   - 0.0.8 : 16.6.2008; restructuring and redesign.#
   - 0.0.9 : 3.6.2009; tidied implementation by using good naming conventions and removing unnecessary functions.
   - 0.0.10 : 3.1.2011; tidied up and switched to polynomial+matrix representation, as well as adding the small scale implementation.
