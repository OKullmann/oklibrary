  \par Version 0.0.11

  \par
   In Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/RamseyTheory/plans/RamseyProblems.hpp
   the following topics are handled:
    - Relations to other modules
    - Symmetry breaking by using symmetries of the solution space

    - Systematics output and output-functions


   \par Version 0.1
   We have rudimentary documentation for all generators, and for %Ramsey
   problems we have translations available for all (standard) forms,
   including some initial symmetry-breaking encodings. And the basic
   methodology for writing generators is in place.
