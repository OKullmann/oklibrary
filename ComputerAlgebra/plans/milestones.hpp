  \par Version history

   - 0.1   : 2.7.2007; quite a few Mupad-functions produced (but without higher design, and not connected to the main concepts of (generalised) satisfiability).
   - 0.1.1 : 5.1.2007; concentration on Maxima: created a file-inclusion-system similar to the C++ system, and provided easy installation and access; also created general documentation, and clarified the roles of Maxima/Lisp vs. Axiom/Aldor. On the way also basic functionality regarding graphs, hypergraphs and satisfiability has been established in Maxima.
