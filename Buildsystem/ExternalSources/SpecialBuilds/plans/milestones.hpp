  \par Version history

   - 0.2   : 16.7.2007; initial version, several special systems can be build (the special builds are the stronger parts of module ExternalSources, while the general structure is lagging behind).
   - 0.2.1 : 10.8.2007; built Sage and Coq (and Boost 1_34_1), and extended substantially the documentation system (docus pages, functionality checks, and linking).
   - 0.2.2 : 21.5.2009; complete updates for many packages (Gmp, R, CMake, MHash), especially much work on installing Maxima and related software (CLisp, Ecl, gnuplot, etc.), making Boost 1_34_1 installing and working on all platforms, some smaller updates (continously Git; attempts with Sage), working out the new general style of build-makefiles (just providing one version "at at time") and update of documentation; several SAT-solvers installed and updated/patched (Ubcsat, Grasp, Satz215, Minsat+, March, SP).
   - 0.2.3 : 24.12.2010; update to newest Boost version, updates, corrections and improvements regarding Maxima (and ECL), update of Gcc-building, updates and extensions for R-building, various improvements to Ubcsat, and various other new installation or updates (Espresso, Doxygen).
