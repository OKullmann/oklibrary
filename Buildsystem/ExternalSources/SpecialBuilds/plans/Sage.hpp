  \brief Plans regarding installation of Sage


  \todo Improving the Sage installation
  <ul>
   <li> Update to Sage 3.0.2. </li>
   <li> Correct dangling links. Likely links to the documentation for other
   systems only work for Maxima, while otherwise these systems have to be
   build externally. </li>
   <li> Install at least Axiom (see Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans/general.hpp, "Computer algebra). </li>
   <li> Update the installation. </li>
  </ul>
