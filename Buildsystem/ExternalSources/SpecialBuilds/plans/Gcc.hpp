  \brief Plans regarding installation of gcc


  \bug gcj doesn't compile java files
  <ul>
   <li> Compiling the following "HelloWorld.java" file using gcj:
   \verbatim
public final class HelloWorld {

  public static void main (final String[] args) {

    System.out.println("Hello world!");

  }

}

   \endverbatim
   yields:
   \verbatim
> $OKPLATFORM/ExternalSources/Installations/Gcc/4.5.3/bin/gcj HelloWorld.java
gcj: error trying to exec 'ecj1': execvp: No such file or directory
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> gcj now requires ecj to be downloaded before building;
   see "--with-ecj-jar" at http://gcc.gnu.org/install/configure.html . </li>
   <li> Apparently, ecj is the Eclipse java compiler, and is under the
   Eclipse Public License. The difference in license is why ecj must be
   downloaded separately. </li>
   <li> One can run:
   \verbatim
> $OKPLATFORM/ExternalSources/builds/Gcc/gcc-4.5.3/contrib/download_ecj
   \endverbatim
   to download ecj.jar to the gcc directory. If this step is run before
   configure, then Gcj should build correctly.
   </li>
   <li> MG is testing building with ecj.jar in the Gcc directory to ensure
   Gcc builds correct. </li>
   <li> However, the difference in licensing raises the issue of whether we
   want to use gcj, and hence ecj, in the OKlibrary. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Providing gcc 4.1.2
  <ul>
   <li> Special 412-targets:
    <ol>
     <li> Programs needing gcc version 4.1.2 might also need the libraries,
     and so actually we might better keep the newly introduced 412-targets
     (which yet are flagged as "to be removed"). </li>
     <li> These targets are boost412, bzip2412, gmp412. </li>
     <li> We should also add mpfr412, and mhash412 (once updated). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE
   Motivated by "GRASP cannot be compiled with gcc version 4.3" (see
   Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans/SAT.hpp), we should provide
   a permanent installation of version 4.1.2. </li>
   <li> DONE
   Perhaps we should provide in general build-variables supporting
   usage of gcc (i.e., calling the compiler, and providing the instructions
   for fixing the shared libraries in the binaries. </li>
   <li> DONE (see 'Putting "configure" under our version control')
   Changed configuration file sources/Gcc/configure-4.1.2.gz:
    <ol>
     <li> On 18.6.2008 this changed file was introduced according to MG;
     ID 4494618f9a8b506adc41934941c81a7554e0c3f6. </li>
     <li> Documentation needs to be added by MG on these changes. </li>
     <li> If we compare it with the most recent gcc-4.1.2.tar.bz2 (with
     md5sum fad77c542b5f467255435ffbeed5ef51; this is the package as
     introduced by MG), then we get
     \verbatim
> diff configure gcc-4.1.2/configure
3552c3552
<        | egrep 'texinfo[^0-9]*(4\.([4-9]|[1-9][0-9])|[5-9]|[1-9][0-9])' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
---
>        | egrep 'texinfo[^0-9]*([1-3][0-9]|4\.[2-9]|[5-9])' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     \endverbatim
     What is the meaning of these changes? </li>
     <li> From a certain version of texinfo (makeinfo etc) onwards, the precise
     format of the version number altered, and even though I had a 
     new enough version of texinfo, without this patch, GCC will error during
     it's configuration step, complaining that I did not have a new enough
     version of texinfo. Applying the patch fixes this issue. See
     http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-binutils@gnu.org/msg04179.html and
     http://code.google.com/p/buildroot/source/browse/branches/john-avr32-buildroot/toolchain/binutils/2.18/100-makeinfo-version.patch?spec=svn705&r=705 .
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE (see 'Putting "configure" under our version control')
   Gcc 4.1.2 will not link on some 64 bit systems
    <ul>
     <li> Gcc 4.1.2 assumes that 32 bit libraries are stored
     in /usr/lib /lib etc rather than /usr/lib32 /lib32 etc. </li>
     <li> This is the case for most linux systems following the
     LSB (Linux Standard Base) conventions however debian-based
     distributions use the later convention. This results
     in the linker not finding the libraries during the building
     of gcc. </li>
     <li> This has been fixed in later versions of gcc, and there
     is a patch available (MG: The patch works for me). </li>
     <li> See http://www.trevorpounds.com/blog/?tag=ubuntu for
     details and a link to the patch. </li>
     <li> An updated version of the GCC package with the patch applied is
     available at http://cs.swan.ac.uk/~csmg/gcc-4.1.2.tar.bz2 , and was
     generated by replacing gcc-4.1.2/gcc/config/i386/t-linux64 with
     the following file (called "t-linux64-new")
     \verbatim
# On x86-64 we do not need any exports for glibc for 64-bit libgcc_s,
# override the settings
# from t-slibgcc-elf-ver and t-linux
SHLIB_MAPFILES = $(srcdir)/libgcc-std.ver \
		 $(srcdir)/config/i386/libgcc-x86_64-glibc.ver


# On Debian, Ubuntu and other derivitive distributions, the 32bit libraries

# /lib and /usr/lib, while other distributions install libraries into /lib64
# and /usr/lib64.  The LSB does not enforce the use of /lib64 and /usr/lib64,
# it doesn't tell anything about the 32bit libraries on those systems.  Set
# MULTILIB_OSDIRNAMES according to what is found on the target.

MULTILIB_OPTIONS = m64/m32
MULTILIB_DIRNAMES = 64 32
MULTILIB_OSDIRNAMES = ../lib64 $(if $(wildcard $(shell echo $(SYSTEM_HEADER_DIR))/../../usr/lib32),../lib32,../lib)


LIBGCC = stmp-multilib
INSTALL_LIBGCC = install-multilib

# The pushl in CTOR initialization interferes with frame pointer elimination.
# crtend*.o cannot be compiled without -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables,
# because then __FRAME_END__ might not be the last thing in .eh_frame
# section.
CRTSTUFF_T_CFLAGS = -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables
     \endverbatim
     which has the following diff with the original
     \verbatim

     \endverbatim
     One can see that the change allows the GCC build system to detect
     whether /lib is used for 64 bit libraries or 32 bit libraries
     </li>
     <li> Therefore, assuming that the above file (t-linux64-new - md5sum = 
     0aae4a50588d97920b7f8ee96789550d ) is in the 
     ExternalSources/sources/Gcc directory, and the original (pre-MG 
     changes) gcc-4.1.2 tarball is called "gcc-4.1.2.tar.bz2" (md5sum
     a4a3eb15c96030906d8494959eeda23c) in the same
     directory, then we have the following procedure for generating the new 
     gcc tarball:
     \verbatim
sources> mv gcc-4.1.2.tar.bz2 gcc-4.1.2.tar.bz2_ALT
sources> tar jxvf gcc-4.1.2.tar.bz2_ALT
sources> cp t-linux64-new gcc-4.1.2/gcc/config/i386/t-linux64
sources> tar jcvf gcc-4.1.2.tar.bz2 gcc-4.1.2
     \endverbatim
     Note, the md5sum will not be the same as the original as the
     creation and modification time etc for t-linux64-new will be different.
     </li>
     <li> Of course, the question is whether this patch is really a general
     improvement, and whether it creates problems with other systems? </li>
     <li> Those who are interested in this patch need to test it on other
     systems. </li>
     <li> And precise information on how to perform the improvements are
     needed (note that we are using already an altered gcc!). </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> We need information about gcc-4.1.2 in the installation page. </li>
   <li> DONE (in the FAQ)
   We need also general information on why we need gcc-4.1.2 etc. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Install GCC 4.5.3 : DONE
  <ul>
   <li> DONE (building it, requiring zip)
   gcj
    <ol>
     <li> Regarding gcj on csoberon we get the error
     \verbatim
checking for unzip... /usr/bin/unzip
Illegal option: @
Usage: jar {ctxui}[vfm0Me] [jar-file] [manifest-file] [entry-point] [-C dir] files ...
     \endverbatim
     with configure for gcj. No zip is available on this machine, which perhaps
     makes the difference (on the other machines we have it). Looks like a
     gcc-bug; contacted the gcc mailing-list. </li>
     <li> For now we disable gcj (don't need it now). </li>
     <li> But we can simply add "zip" to the requirement. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE (we require zip)
   We need to install zip locally, and provide it to the gcc-build.
    <ol>
     <li> Building it shouldn't be a problem. </li>
     <li> Gcc doesn't make provisions for that. </li>
     <li> So apparently one has to modify the path when installing gcc? </li>
     <li> Alternatively we could put it into OKplatform/bin. </li>
     <li> However this wouldn't solve the provision-problem, since (at least
     yet) we say that putting OKplatform/bin on PATH isn't required. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE (we require now also zlib, and use this)
   Build error on cs-oksvr:
    <ol>
     <li> We get (for "oklib gcc")
     \verbatim
checking dynamic linker characteristics... configure: error: Link tests are not allowed after GCC_NO_EXECUTABLES.
make[3]: *** [configure-stage1-zlib] Error 1
     \endverbatim
     </li>
     <li> It seems that is a bug in the gcc build (fixed hopefully in the next
     version). </li>
     <li> A proposal on the gcc mailing-list is to use --with-system-zlib.
     </li>
     <li> This can be done by
     \verbatim
ExternalSources> oklib gcc gcc_user_options_okl="--with-system-zlib"
     \endverbatim
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Loop-optimisation
  <ul>
   <li> We should also install these additional libraries "PPL" ("Parma
   Polyhedra Library") and "CLooG" for loop-optimisation. </li>
  </ul>
  

  \todo Latest texi2dvi fails to build gcc.texi on some systems
  <ul>
   <li> The latest texinfo package has a bug due to poor formatting of
   strings passed to egrep, which results in an error from texi2dvi during
   the gcc (4.5.2) build process complaining about precisely this. </li>
   <li> The error arises as texi2dvi uses egrep with using "[A-z]" rather
   than "[A-Za-z]", and the first isn't a valid pattern when using certain
   unicode (UTF-8 type) character sets. </li>
   <li> One can run "LC_ALL=C oklib gcc" and the build completes without a
   problem. </li>
   <li> According to
   http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-texinfo@gnu.org/msg04519.html
   and the corresponding bug report, there is now a fix, and presumably
   this should be available in a new texinfo package soon on most systems.
   </li>
   <li> This is not a bug in the OKlibrary, but users should be aware of the
   issue. </li>
  </ul>


  \bug DONE (no system-libraries needed anymore)
  Local Gmp/Mpfr are not used (appropriately)
  <ul>
   <li> The system-subdirectories of Gmp/Mpfr installation directories
   should not sit inside the directory with the gcc-version on the path ---
   the access to the system-version must be independent of the recommended
   gcc-version. </li>
  </ul>


  \bug DONE (the internal build of Gmp+Mpfr does static linking; dynamic
  linking would be possible using the additional information from the gcc
  mailing list)
  How to use local Gmp + Mpfr?
  <ul>
   <li> Just using "--with-gmp" and "--with-mpfr" is not enough, but some
   linking information is needed --- only which? </li>
   <li> Apparently LD_LIBRARY_PATH is to be used?
   \verbatim
checking whether the GNU Fortran compiler is working... no
configure: error: GNU Fortran is not working; the most common reason for that is that you might have linked it to shared GMP and/or MPFR libraries, and not set LD_LIBRARY_PATH accordingly. If you suspect any other reason, please report a bug in http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla, attaching /home/kullmann/OKplatform/ExternalSources/builds/Gcc/gcc-4.2.4_build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/libgfortran/config.log
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> However prefixing the configure-call by
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(gmp_locsys_install_directory_okl)/lib:$(mpfr_locsys_install_directory_okl)/lib"
   has apparently no effect? </li>
   <li> In gcc-4.2.4_build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/libgfortran/config.log
   we find the usual f951-problem:
   \verbatim
/home/kullmann/OKplatform/ExternalSources/builds/Gcc/gcc-4.2.4_build/./gcc/f951: error while loading shared libraries: libmpfr.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> The library-file libmpfr.so.4 is in the Mpfr-lib-directory:
   \verbatim
kullmann-0:lib> pwd
/home/kullmann/OKplatform/ExternalSources/Installations/Mpfr/system/3.0.0/lib
kullmann-0:lib> ls -l
total 1256
-rw-r--r-- 1 kullmann users 896598 2010-12-26 21:56 libmpfr.a
-rwxr-xr-x 1 kullmann users   1165 2010-12-26 21:56 libmpfr.la
lrwxrwxrwx 1 kullmann users     16 2010-12-26 21:56 libmpfr.so -> libmpfr.so.4.0.0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 kullmann users     16 2010-12-26 21:56 libmpfr.so.4 -> libmpfr.so.4.0.0
-rwxr-xr-x 1 kullmann users 381897 2010-12-26 21:56 libmpfr.so.4.0.0
   \endverbatim
   So apparently LD_LIBRARY_PATH is just ignored. </li>
   <li> Tryin
   \verbatim
LDFLAGS="-L $(gmp_locsys_install_directory_okl)/lib -L $(mpfr_locsys_install_directory_okl)/lib"
   \endverbatim
   instead. But again this is just ignored. </li>
   <li> Finally trying
   \verbatim
LDFLAGS="$(gmp_locsys_link_path_okl) $(mpfr_locsys_link_path_okl)"
   \endverbatim
   And again, this is just ignored. Exactly the same f951-error as above. The
   configure script continued with some reports, and contains the line
   "LDFLAGS=''", which seems a clear indication of a error in the
   build-script. </li>
  </ul>


  \bug DONE (works now; problems were Gmp,Mpfr related)
  Local build of Fortran fails (for 4.1.2)
  <ul>
   <li> DONE (we don't build Fortran with 4.1.2)
   We get (for "oklib gcc") an error when building
   libgfortran:
   \verbatim
/home/kullmann/OKplatform/ExternalSources/builds/Gcc/gcc-4.1.2/libgfortran/mk-kinds-h.sh: Unknown type
grep '^#' < kinds.h > kinds.inc
/bin/sh: kinds.h: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** [kinds.inc] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/kullmann/OKplatform/ExternalSources/builds/Gcc/gcc-4.1.2_build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/libgfortran'
make[2]: *** [all-target-libgfortran] Error 2
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> The error message "unknown type" is from the script
   libgfortran/mk-kinds-h.sh. This is an example of a bad error-message:
    <ol>
     <li> There are two possible places for this output, without a possibility
     to distinguish them. </li>
     <li> They do not show the bad value (some size) under consideration. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Inserting output, it seems it comes from "case $largest_ctype",
   where apparently the value of largest_ctype is the empty string. </li>
   <li> When compiling
   \verbatim
libgfortran> more tmp17093.f90 
  real (kind=16) :: x
  end
   \endverbatim
   one gets apparently an error (where there shouldn't be one):
   \verbatim
libgfortran> /home/kullmann/OKplatform/ExternalSources/builds/Gcc/gcc-4.1.2_build/./gcc/gfortran -c tmp17093.f90 
gfortran: error trying to exec 'f951': execvp: No such file or directory
   \endverbatim
   and thus largest_ctype is not re-set. </li>
   <li> We get the same error on cs-wsok (Suse 10.0). </li>
   <li> An Internet-search is needed: It seems that the build has linking
   problems with Mpfr (see
   http://lists.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/openembedded-issues/2007-November/006519.html
   ). There is other noise denying (as usual) any fault on the side of gcc,
   and blaming Gmp, recommending to use
     --host=none --target=none --build=none
   to disable platform-specific optimization (which wouldn't matter much here,
   since these libraries are only used at compile-time), however this doesn't
   seem likely here to me. </li>
   <li> Let's try later gcc-versions --- perhaps the problem has been solved
   there (we could use later gcc-versions for Fortran (only)).
    <ol>
     <li> DONE (actually this was only due to not using local Gmp/Mpfr; see
     above)
     Version 4.2.4 seems to install without problems (including gfortran).
     </li>
     <li> However yet we can't use it; see "Local installation of gfortran"
     in Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans/R.hpp. </li>
     <li> It is likely an R-build-problem, but we need to check. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The newest version 3.0.0 of Mpfr doesn't seem to make a difference.
   </li>
   <li> Also without the library-settings for gmp-/mpfr we get the same
   error (on csltok; must have gone unnoticed before), so it seems it is
   not related to these additional settings. </li>
   <li> DONE (everything is now built with the system-gcc)
   Perhaps a link-failure: Now we compile gfortran with 4.1.2, while
   the system-compiler is 4.5.0 --- perhaps building gfortran links to
   something compiled with 4.5.0 ? </li>
   <li> DONE (we have now system-versions of gmp and mpfr)
   However it seems we need to build with (our) 4.1.2, since we need to
   use gmp and mpfr (which are build with (our) gcc 4.1.2.) ? </li>
   <li> We need to find out what are the precise requirements when building
   gfortran (version 4.1.2). </li>
   <li> DONE (handled now in this way)
   An alternative procedure would be to first build gcc-4.1.2 (only C and
   C++ compiler) with the system-compiler, building then gmp amd mpfr with the
   system-compiler as "system"-versions, and then building gfortran-4.1.2
   (as well as the current full gcc-suite) with the system-compiler, using
   these gmp and mpfr. </li>
   <li> Then for gmp,mpfr we would need three versions: the system-version,
   the 4.1.2-version, the current version. So well, seems appropriate. </li>
   <li> DONE
   Then actually gmp and mpfr should be build first, and then all of
   gcc can be build at once --- no need to separate the fortran-build! </li>
  </ul>


  \todo DONE (moved files into Programming/Specifics/Gcc/412)
  Putting "configure" under our version control
  <ul>
   <li> Since there are now various changes to various gcc-configuration files,
   we should put them under our version control. </li>
   <li> Starting with the files in the original gcc-4.1.2-package. </li>
   <li> It seems that the md5sum-value of the gcc-package is for the original
   package, then the new general configure-file was introduced, and then
   the special configuration-file as discussed below. (It seems these were
   the only changes.) </li>
   <li> We handle it then as with for example Ubcsat: the package is the
   original, and during the build the new files are placed. </li>
   <li> The appropriate place for the gcc-replacement files seems
   Programming/SystemSpecifics/Gcc. </li>
   <li> At this time Programming/SystemSpecifics/plans/milestones.hpp
   should be updated. </li>
   <li> The Externalsources/sources/gcc-4.1.2.tar.bz2 is now the original
   from the Gcc site with md5sum a4a3eb15c96030906d8494959eeda23c. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo DONE (solved now --- with build 4.1.2 only for C,C++)
  GCC 4.1.2 will not build on systems without GMP with MPFR support
  <ul>
   <li> DONE (we built gmp and mpfr locally, and compile Fortran then; needs
   to be checked though)
   GCC 4.1.2 fails to build on some machines (notably the Swansea 
   University Computer Science Linux lab machines), with the following error:
   \verbatim
checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) is a cross-compiler... no
checking whether we are using GNU C... yes
checking whether gcc accepts -g... yes
checking for gnatbind... gnatbind
checking whether compiler driver understands Ada... no
checking how to compare bootstrapped objects... cmp --ignore-initial=16 $$f1 $$f2
checking for correct version of gmp.h... yes
checking for MPFR... no
configure: error: GMP with MPFR support is required to build fortran
make: *** [gcc] Error 1
make: Leaving directory `/tmp/OKlib/OKplatform/ExternalSources'
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> DONE (at the moment we just have everything built with "our" gcc
   version 4.1.2; later we will have this and the builds with our newest
   version)
   Ideally we could just build GMP and MPFR as part of the OKlibrary
   build process, however, these libraries would then build using a newer
   version of GCC and we run the risk of there being incompatibilities
   with the version we are building when we start to compile anything in
   the library which might somehow link to standard libraries. </li>
   <li> The GCC website (http://gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html) 
   suggests it should be possible to simply drop GMP and MPFR source
   directories in the GCC source directory and build as normal :
   \verbatim
GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP) version 4.3.2 (or later)
    Necessary to build GCC. If you do not have it installed in your library search path, you will have to configure with the --with-gmp configure option. See also --with-gmp-lib and --with-gmp-include. Alternatively, if a GMP source distribution is found in a subdirectory of your GCC sources named gmp, it will be built together with GCC.
MPFR Library version 2.4.2 (or later)
    Necessary to build GCC. It can be downloaded from http://www.mpfr.org/. The --with-mpfr configure option should be used if your MPFR Library is not installed in your default library search path. See also --with-mpfr-lib and --with-mpfr-include. Alternatively, if a MPFR source distribution is found in a subdirectory of your GCC sources named mpfr, it will be built together with GCC.

   </li>
   <li> However, building GCC with GMP and MPFR source directories "in-tree"
   (as such a method is called) with GCC 4.1.2 doesn't work yielding the same 
   error. </li>
   <li> Either additional configure options are needed, or GCC 4.1.2 doesn't
   support this. Perhaps such functionality has only been introduced in later
   GCC versions?
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo DONE (we go directly to 4.5.2, to minimise problems with additional
  libraries)
  Install GCC 4.2.4
  <ul>
   <li> First only as an alternative (since yet code doesn't compile with
   versions 4.2 or later). </li>
   <li> Installation seems to work, however not for gfortran with local
   Gmp+Mpfr (see above). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo DONE (we go directly to 4.5.2, to minimise problems with additional libraries)
  Install GCC 4.3.5


  \todo DONE (we go directly to 4.5.2, to minimise problems with additional libraries)
  Install GCC 4.4.5
  <ul>
   <li> DONE (we use 4.4.5, and we build local Gmp+Mpfr using system-gcc)
   Building 4.4.4:
    <ol>
     <li> Now Gmp and Mpfr is needed. </li>
     <li> For Gmp just use the configure-option
     "--with-gmp=$(gmp_installation_dir_okl)". </li>
     <li> However, then we have the problem of a circular dependency, since
     these libraries are built using Gcc! </li>
     <li> The main question is about the link-library-compatabilities. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Building error (on csltok):
    <ol>
     <li> We get

     </li>
     <li> So here already with libgcc (not with libgfortran) we get an error??
     </li>
     <li> In gcc-4.4.5_build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/libgcc/config.log we find
     \verbatim
/home/kullmann/OKplatform/ExternalSources/builds/Gcc/gcc-4.4.5_build/./gcc/cc1: error while loading shared libraries: libmpfr.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

     so, as usual, the linking-specifications are ignored. Later one finds
     (again) "LDFLAGS=''". </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The installation-documentation doesn't say anything on this. </li>
   <li> It seems that now also libraries "PPL" ("Parma Polyhedra Library")
   and "CLooG" are needed? Not needed, both are only for loop-optimisation.
   </li>
   <li> Since we need the system-versions of Gmp and Mpfr apparently only
   for Gcc, we should try to put source-directories "gmp" and "mpfr" into
   the extracted gcc-source. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Installation in general
  <ul>
   <li> Documentation:
    <ol>
     <li> Linking to the gcc-documentation (main info-page) should be checked
     for completeness. </li>
     <li> We could offer also to show the man-page (just open it into a
     browser); however then it should be said that likely the
     html-documentation is more complete. </li>
     <li> We should also move the info-pages to the doc-directory. How to view
     them? The least is just to open them into a browser. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE (not used anymore)
   If variable "gcc_version_okl" is set, then it should have one of the
   allowed values (while otherwise we get an error). </li>
   <li> We must understand, how gcc interacts with 32- and 64-bit
   environments, and how to take control of this. </li>
   <li> There should be make-variables, which allow control over
   some settings for the build of gcc. </li>
   <li> texti2pdf is a script, which can be put into ~/bin for example,
   and is needed for building the gcc-documentation --- how to provide it?
   Such small utilities could be put under version control (OKlibrary) ? </li>
   <li> Installation of R requires a Fortran compiler. Therefore the 
    system-installation of Gcc should allow for enabling of Fortran
    language support. </li>
   <li> DONE (yes, GMP and MPFR are installed locally)
   Enabling Fortran language support in Gcc requires that the MPFR
    and GMP libraries are installed. Should we install these also locally?
    <ol>
     <li> GMP is also of interest to us regarding big-number-types, so we need
     full control about it, and perhaps a local installation is warranted
     (ignoring the system installation). UPDATE NEEDED </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE (placed in Buildsystem/Configuration)
   Shouldn't file external_sources_versions.mak be placed in subdirectory
   Buildsystem/ExternalSources ? </li>
   <li> DONE (it seems reasonable
   to remove the build-directory from the prerequisite-list and to build it
   "manually")
   If the filestamp does already exist, then we want nothing to happen ---
   however yet the build-directory will be rebuilt if not existent, since
   it is a prerequisite of the rule for the "tag-paths". So it seems
   necessary to remove the build-directory from the prerequisite-list,
   however then it seems impossible to create the build-directory, if actually
   gcc *is* to be build, via the target-mechanism. </li>
   <li> DONE (now just "oklib gcc", and potentially setting 
  gcc_recommended_version_number_okl)
   Instead of, %e.g., "make gcc-4.1.2", wouldn't it be more consistent with
   building Boost to also have "make gcc gcc-version=4.1.2" ? </li>
  </ul>
