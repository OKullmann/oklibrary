  \brief Plans regarding building packages related to boolean functions

  See OKlib/Satisfiability/FiniteFunctions/plans/general.hpp for
  the central module regarding boolean functions (and generalisations).


  \todo BDD's
  <ul>
    <li> CUDD http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/ </li>
    <li> Buddy http://sourceforge.net/projects/buddy </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Aiger
  <ul>
   <li> AIGER http://fmv.jku.at/aiger contains tools for handling AIGs
   (special boolean circuits). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo ABC
  <ul>
   <li> http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/ </li>
   <li> Seems to be rather comprehensive. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Translations to SAT
  <ul>
   <li> MNI Proposition Analyzer (MPA)
   http://homepages.fh-giessen.de/~hg11260/hp_p7_de.html
   seems to be a smaller program, translating various forms of propositional
   SAT problems into CNF, and/or solving them directly (based on SAT4J). </li>
   <li> See "BAT" in
   Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans/ModelChecking.hpp. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Boolean functions
  <ul>
    <li> DONE (now automatically installed)
    There is an R-package with Quine/McCluskey etc.
     <ol>
      <li> Installation (from CRAN)
      \verbatim
> oklib --R
# Within R environment
> install.packages("QCA")
      \endverbatim
      This draws the package from external CRAN sources. The lpSolve package 
      dependency seems to be already installed for R in oklib.
      </li>
      <li> Installation (from source tarball)
      \verbatim
ExternalSources/Installations/R> oklib --R
# Within R environment (with  QCA_0.5-0.tar.gz in the current directory)
> install.packages("QCA_0.5-0.tar.gz", repos=NULL)
      \endverbatim
      Setting the "repos" parameter to null seems to force it to treat the 
      package arguments as file paths to tar.gz packages.
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
    <li> http://www.dei.isep.ipp.pt/~ACC/bfunc/ seems not to be open source.
    </li>
    <li> http://www.tcs.hut.fi/~tjunttil/circuits/index.html has translators
    and
    generators for boolean circuits. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Logic synthesis
  <ul>
   <li> http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/Slots/slots/LogicSynthesis.html </li>
   <li> Scherzo
    <ol>
     <li> Developed by Olivier Coudert (http://www.ocoudert.com/). </li>
     <li> Uses implicit BDD representation for primes and reduction
     techniques to avoid blow up in size of problem due to large
     numbers of prime implicates. </li>
     <li> Coudert has provided the code to MG, although it is not
     clear whether he would be willing to make it open-source. </li>
     <li> The source builds with some minor Makefile changes but
     segfaults. This seems likely to be an issue with how MG is building
     it and the difference in architectures (Scherzo seems to have been
     developed for systems other than standard x86 / x86_64). </li>
     <li> MG needs to e-mail Coudert again to check whether he would
     be willing to open-source the application. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> BOOM
    <ol> 
     <li> Developed by Petr Fiser 
     (http://service.felk.cvut.cz/vlsi/prj/BOOM/). </li>
     <li> Non-exact boolean minimisation, but allows iterative
     minimisation. </li>
     <li> According to experimental results on the project site,
     the software is highly competitive. </li>
     <li> License requires authors reference particular papers if
     one uses the software, and one must provide details to download
     the software (MG hasn't done this). </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Using genetic programming:
    <ol>
     <li> There are quite a few papes on finding (digital) circuits via
     genetic programming, but apparently no software. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Grigory Yaroslavtsev and Alexander Kulikov have written some software
   to find short circuits (over the full binary base for example). </li>
   <li> egntott http://code.google.com/p/eqntott/ </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Improve documentation for Espresso
  <ul>
   <li> We should improve the source-code, so that the option "--version"
   is recognised. </li>
   <li> At the ExternalSources page we need an index-page for the various
   pieces of documentation we have. </li>
   <li> We need to investigate what is in espresso-book-examples.tar.gz:
    <ul>
     <li> This tarball contains a variety of different PLA files, which
     don't have any documentation along with them. </li>
     <li> There is a book "Logic Minimization Algorithms for VLSI Synthesis"
     by Robert Brayton (the author of Espresso). </li>
     <li> Given the name of the tarball, "Logic Minimization Algorithms for
     VLSI Synthesis" seems a likely candidate for the "book" the filename
     refers to (MG has ordered a copy). </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> The PLA format:
    <ul>
     <li> The "PLA format" is documented at
     ExternalSources/sources/Boolean/Espresso/espresso.5.html with additional
     information in
     ExternalSources/sources/Boolean/Espresso/man_octtools_espresso.html. </li>
     <li> A PLA file represents m partial boolean functions,
     f_i : A_i -> {0,1} for i in {1,...,m} and A_i a subset of {0,1}^n. </li>
     <li> It does this by encoding a table of rows of n+m values in {0,1,-}.
     </li>
     <li> The PLA file starts with a header and other commands followed
     by a (possibly empty) list of data-lines. </li>
     <li> Lines starting with # are comments, and can appear at any place in
     the file. </li>
     <li> Additional whitespace other than that specified as delimiters is
     ignored. However, it is generally expected, by tools that use PLA files,
     that data-lines are single lines. </li>
     <li> The "header" of the PLA file:
     \verbatim
.i n
.o m
     \endverbatim
     specifies the number, n, of input variables and, m, of partial boolean
     functions where n and m are the positive integers. </li>
     <li> Additional lines such as ".type" (discussed below), and
     others discussed in the documentation, may also be specified in
     the "header" of the file. </li>
     <li> After the header come the data-lines, specifying the m partial
     boolean functions with a matrix of {0,1,-} values. </li>
     <li> Each data-line is a string of length n+m over the alphabet
     {0,1,-}, possibly separated by (ignored) whitespace. </li>
     <li> Each data-line splits into
      <ul>
       <li> I : the input values; the first n {0,1,-} characters.
       </li>
       <li> O : the output values for the partial boolean functions;
       the last m values. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> For each data line, define I* to be the set of all possible
     strings of length n where all "-" characters in I have either
     been replaced by 0 or 1. That is, I* is the set of size 2^k of all
     possible replacements where k is the number of "-" characters in I.
     </li>
     <li> A data-line encodes, for all i in {1,..,m} and I' in I*, that
      <ol>
       <li> f_i(I') = O[i] if O[i] is in {0,1}; </li>
       <li> f_i(I') is undefined otherwise. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
     <li> For all i in {1,...,m}, f_i is considered to be 0
     for inputs which were not specified in the PLA, although this
     interpretation can be changed using the ".type" option.
     </li>
     <li> Data-lines should not specify conflicting values for any
     of the partial boolean functions. </li>
     <li> So, by default, for all i in {1,...,m}, we have that
     f_i : A_i -> {0,1} is defined such that
      <ul>
       <li> A_i is the subset of {0,1}^n; </li>
       <li> Vector V is in A_i if there is *no* data-line in the PLA file
       such that V = I modulo substition of "-" characters, and O[i] = "-";
       </li>
       <li> f_i(V) = 1 if there exists a data-line in the PLA file where
       V = I modulo substitution of "-" characters and O[i] = 1; </li>
       <li> f_i(V) = 0 if either
        <ul>
         <li> there exists a data-line in the PLA file where
         V = I modulo substitution of "-" characters and O[i] = 0, or </li>
         <li> there doesn't exist a data-line in the PLA file such that
         V = I modulo substitution of "-" characters at all. </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> The type option,
     \verbatim
.type X
     \endverbatim
     specifies how to interpret total assignments left
     unspecified for each f_i, and those for which it is undefined.
     X is one of the following:
      <ul>
       <li> "f": unspecified assignments *and* those with
       undefined outputs ("-") are assumed to be false (0). </li>
       <li> "r": unspecified assignments *and* those with undefined outputs
       are assumed to be true (1). </li>
       <li> "fd": unspecified assignments are assumed to be false
       (the default for espresso), others are taken as defined. </li>
       <li> "fr": unspecified assignments are considered to be
       undefined. </li>
       <li> "fdr": there should be no unspecified values, and
       any tool should return an error if such an unspecified
       input is detected. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> The PLA standard also allows one to provide names for variables,
     as well as other options which give Espresso information on how
     to minimise the finite function provided. These options are discussed
     in ExternalSources/sources/Boolean/Espresso/espresso.5.html. </li>
     <li> Examples:
      <ul>
       <li> The two bit adder (from the espresso documentation):
       \verbatim
# 2-bit by 2-bit binary adder (with no carry input)
.i 4
.o 3
0000  000
0001  001
0010  010
0011  011
0100  001
0101  010
0110  011
0111  100
1000  010
1001  011
1010  100
1011  101
1100  011
1101  100
1110  101
1111  110
       \endverbatim
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> At the maxima level:
      <ul>
       <li> DONE (see output_fcl2pla in
       ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/ClauseSets/BasicOperations.mac)
       We should provide functions to take a formal clause-list F
       and output a PLA file. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Finite functions:
      <ul>
       <li> The PLA format allows one to specify that certain boolean
       variables should be considered together as a single multi-valued
       variable. </li>
       <li> Rather than using ".i" and ".o" to specify the number of input
       and partial finite functions, one specifies:
       \verbatim
.mi n nb d1 ... dm
       \endverbatim
       where n is the total number of variables, nb is the number of boolean
       variables (always given first in the variable ordering), and di
       is the number of bits used to represent the i'th multi-valued variable.
       </li>
       <li> The function is then specified as before, but the bits in
       multi-valued variables are separated by "|" and the last multi-valued
       variable is the output value (no space-separation). </li>
       <li> For example (from the manual):
       \verbatim
.mv 8 5 2 3 4
0-010|10|100|0000
10-10|10|010|1000
       \endverbatim
       </li>
       <li> We need to better understand multi-valued PLAs and relate it
       to our own considerations of non-boolean clause-sets etc. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> All remaining options allowed in a PLA file should be documented
     here and then this later moved to docus. </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> We need to fully specify (in our system, using our language) what
   "PLAs" are, and create documentation for that. Perhaps we also need that
   at Maxima-level. </li>
  </ul>


  \bug DONE (added additional entries to the configuration specific
  to the source directories)
  False build for Espresso
  <ul>
   <li> The directory names do not follow our standards. </li>
   <li> In particular, espresso has the package name
   "espresso-ab-1.0-2.3.tar.gz" and directory names
   "espresso-ab-1.0", and yet it's executable name is
   "espresso2.3", all of which are very different. </li>
   <li> This initial decision was made so as not to change
   the version information too much from the original (keeping
   with the authors original version information (1.0)) but adding
   more reasonable version information at the same time (the
   version number as printed by the executable). </li>
   <li> To bring things inline with other packages, espresso
   should simply be repackaged to "espresso-2.3.tar.bz2" with
   "espresso-2.3" as the directory name and "espresso2.3" as
   the executable name. </li>
  </ul>
