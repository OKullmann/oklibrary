  </ul>
  
  
  <h2> Outline </h2>
  
  <p>
   The OKlibrary is a research platform on generalised satisfiability and
   related fields, providing
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li> a computer-algebra based system (using Maxima/Lisp) for
    specification and prototyping, </li>
   <li> a generative C++ library (using modern C++), </li>
   <li> and extensions by external tools, including systems from logic,
    optimisation, statistics and discrete mathematics. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The library is open source (under GPLv3), and a strong integrated source
   control system yields full control over the development process.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Special services provided include:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li> A powerful build system for compiling programs and running tests. </li>
   <li> An extensive documentation system, ranging from extracting program
    documentation to planning support. </li>
   <li> Installation and usage support for external packages, including
    tools used for programming and related activities. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
   Much emphasise is put on placing the development process in a wider
   context:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li> The relations to neighbour fields, for example constraint
    satisfaction and graph theory, or complexity theory and automated
    theorem proving, are important, and collaboration shall be supported.
   </li>
   <li> Usage of existing software ("external sources") is strongly
    encouraged. </li>
   <li> A central problem in using external sources are the various
    dependencies which arise in this way, and the OKlibrary tries to
    lighten this burden by establishing a common environment for
    installation and usage. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   To summarise:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li> The OKlibrary is an environment for attacking (allegedly)
    "intractable problems", with SAT in generalised form at its centre.
   </li>
   <li> It aims at making accessible all related worlds from mathematics,
    informatics and software engineering.
   </li>
  </ol>
  
  
  <hr />
   
   
   <h2> The subject and its platform </h2>
   
   <p>
    "Generalised satisfiability" includes the following fields:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li> Constraint satisfaction from the point of view of SAT, that is,
     with emphasise
     <ul>
      <li> on algorithms, not on language, </li>
      <li> and on partial assignments and clauses for reasoning
       and learning algorithms. </li>
     </ul>
     One might say, that
     <ol>
      <li> SAT is considered as an abstract data type, for achieving
       "global intelligence", </li>
      <li> while CSP provides intelligent special methods for
       "local intelligence". </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
    <li> Quantified extensions like QBF. </li>
    <li> Generalising clauses like in PB-solvers and SMT. </li>
    <li> Investigations into special structures (for example Ramsey-type
     problems). </li>
    <li> Any applications. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Important is the research character, and "purely" theoretical algorithms
    are welcome.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Though not "core business", many other areas are important for SAT, and
    thus are also integrated into the library:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li> Logic </li>
    <li> Complexity theory </li>
    <li> Graph and hypergraph theory </li>
    <li> Combinatorics in general </li>
    <li> Algebra. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    To avoid re-inventing many wheels, much emphasise is put on the use of
    external sources.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    For supporting areas like statistics and numerical computation, powerful
    external systems are employed.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Modern C++, and generative and active libraries are of importance to
    overcome the split between efficiency and generality, and the library
    also undertakes practical research in these areas.
   </p>
   
   
   <h3> An integrated research environment </h3>
   
   <p>
    An open source library which supports research on such a variety of
    fields needs special means for collaboration:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li> To support a wide range of research, the library is an "active
     library", and its full use means development within the framework.
    </li>
    <li> Compared with common "IDEs" ("integrated development environments"),
     the OKlibrary can be understood as an <strong>"IRE"</strong>
     ("integrated research environment"). </li>
    <li> It is possible to use the library in the traditional way, as
     "include-and-link-only", but then many parts of the library are
     left out. </li>
    <li> The library provides means to develop within the library, but
     nevertheless to keep processes encapsulated. </li>
   </ul>
   
   
   <h3> A holistic library </h3>
   
   <p>
    The OKlibrary is a generative and active
    library, integrating services and activities traditionally not part of
    the delivered package and thus not easily usable:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li> In this <a href="m4_SHELL(rel_aims_accu2006_talk_location)"> talk
     </a> the general ideas of "holistic libraries", with emphasise on the
     higher order unit test system (see below), are outlined.
    </li>
    <li> A more complete account is found in this <a
      href="m4_SHELL(rel_aims_oklibrary_report2009_location)"> report </a>.
    </li>
    <li> The general principle of active or generative libraries is, that all
     aspects of the programming process (like configuration knowledge)
     should be made available within the system (so that they become
     amenable to automation). </li>
    <li> We go beyond this level by including also planning and discussion
     (which are not amenable to automation). </li>
    <li> At the general level, only C++ is supported as a programming
     language, however for special purposes specialised languages have been
     selected.
     <ol>
      <li> The <a href="ProgrammingLanguages.html">discussion</a> gives an
       overview on the design choices for the (formal) languages used in
       the OKlibrary. </li>
      <li> The integration with other programming languages (like Java)
       shall happen via the mechanism of external sources, which make
       available the source code and the compiled products, while the
       strength of C++ is exploited to be able to link with many other
       languages. </li>
      <li> Interfaces to other SAT libraries are important for the
       OKlibrary. </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>
    A remark on terminology: "generative" and "active" are used in the field
    of generative programming, while "holistic" is my (OK) own extended
    version of it. These notions are, in general and for our library, under
    active development.
   </p>

    <h2> The organisation of participation </h2>
    
    <p>
     The basic organisation principles for development are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li> On the one hand we have the core distribution, over which the core
      development team has control, with me ("OK", that is, Oliver Kullmann)
      as the main developer and copyright holder.
      <ol>
       <li> Strict coding standards and adherence to the design principles
        developed in the OKlibrary make interaction of the many different
        components possible. </li>
       <li> At the C++ level, the development process aims at full
        generality and genericity. </li>
       <li> At the Maxima/Lisp level, the development process aims at
   elegance and clarity combined with precision, avoiding "premature"
   abstraction. </li>
   <li> Prototypes in various forms are supported,
    but this within the framework of abstract ideas developed by the
    OKlibrary. </li>
   <li> Unity of the many theoretical and practical aspects of
    SAT is central to the OKlibrary, which concretely means that
    all components shall work together in one ("big") world --- through
    abstraction by generic and generative programming at the C++ level,
    by systematically developed conversions at the Maxima/Lisp level.
 </li>
  <li> The control over the core distribution includes strict control
   over version numbers (important for communicating the current
   standing). </li>
  <li> Plans and milestones at the core level can only be developed
   in close collaboration with the core development team. </li>
 </ol>
  Thus development at the core level is under control,
  <ol>
   <li> restricted by necessary adherence to general principles and
    ideas, </li>
   <li> which shall guarantee that the components admitted play
    together now and in the future. </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
  <li> On the other hand we have the open space of the "virtual library"
   as a network of distributed clones:
   <ol>
    <li> The anticipated development model for "normal" users is not the
     centralised submission to the core, but a decentralised model.
    </li>
    <li> Every external developer can take his clone of the OKlibrary
     as the centre of its own universe, where he and his team can
     play the same role as OK and his team for the core library. </li>
    <li> Essential is the idea of the OKlibrary as a "holistic library",
     which is open source taken to the maximum: Every user shall get the
     same possibilities as the core developers. </li>
    <li> If at some point the integration with the core library is
     wished, two basic models are considered:
     <ul>
      <li> Either by a concentrated joined effort the full integration
       into the core (which might make larger rewrites necessary).
      </li>
      <li> Or the loose integration as an external source, with various
       forms of external testing applied. </li>
     </ul>
     While at the core level a strong effort is undertaken to guarantee
     a high level of development, obviously this is not possible for
     external efforts --- which are then (obviously) free to do whatever
     they want.
    </li>
    <li> Clones of the OKlibrary which go public should make clear their
     heritage (besides what is given by the licence), but also should
     make clear the difference (which likely is in the
     interest of the external group). </li>
    <li> The history of the development of the OKlibrary, as reported by
     the source control system, is integral part of the OKlibrary.
     <ol>
      <li> We expect that every external distribution of clones will
       respect the integrity of the history. </li>
      <li> If external distributions of clones present an incomplete
       or changed history, we will make strong efforts to make
       this publically known. If possible, also legal means
       might be used. </li>
      <li> Here "history" essentially refers to the history as
       presented by the source-code-management-system (Git in our
       case):
       <ul>
        <li> "completeness" means that the sequence of submissions is
         not interrupted; </li>
        <li> "unchanged" means that the single submissions are
         unchanged. </li>
       </ul>
       Git was chosen here since it provides cryptographic means for
       protecting the integrity of the history, and it is fast and
       powerful.
      </li>
      <li> The core development team makes a strong effort to guarantee
       the completeness of the history, so that every contribution,
       small or big, is visible in the history provided by the
       version control. </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
   </ol>
  </li>      
 </ul>
  <p>
   We should emphasise, that yet we do not have much experience with the
   "fractal nature" of the "network of clones" (with the OKlibrary as
   its original source), so a lot needs to be learned.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3> The public source-code repository </h3>
  
  <p>
   Technically, participation is organised as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li> At the <a href="m4_SHELL(git_http_address_okl)"> public git
     repository </a> the repository can be inspected. </li>
   <li> The git-address to clone from is
    "m4_SHELL(git_http_repository)". </li>
   <li> This is also the default when pulling from a repository built
    from a package. </li>
   <li> Collaboration happens with the help of
    <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> as follows:
    <ol>
     <li> A "fork" of the OKlibrary is created there. </li>
     <li> This fork is cloned at the local workspace of the developer,
      edited there, and pushed back to the fork at Github. </li>
     <li> Then the team at the original source is notified, and invited
      to pull the changes from the fork. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> See module "Buildsystem/SourceControl" for further information on
    the usage of Git. </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h3> On the release process </h3>
  
  <ul>
   <li> To ease the start, packages containing everything related to
    the library are provided at the OKlibrary Internet page. </li>
   <li> On the average they appear once a weak, and are identified by
    a five-digit running number. </li>
   <li> These packages might also be used to update an existing
    installation, though in most cases
    <ol>
     <li> pulling the changes from the main repository (just by using
      "git pull"), </li>
     <li> and updating the external sources by (selectively) downloading
      them from the OKlibrary Internet site, </li>
    </ol>
    suffices.
   </li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h3> The planning process </h3>
  
  <p>
   Central is the planning process:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li> Every action is announced by plans (in the corresponding
    plans-file), so that others know what's going on and can participate.
    Also only in this way the typical loss due to interruptions is
    avoided. </li>
   <li> These plans are continuously evolved, so that before programming
    starts, a good "loose specification" is available. </li>
   <li> Plans must be kept up-to-date, and also the corresponding
    milestone-entries. </li>
   <li> So much of the planning process happens *within* the OKlibrary
    (not, as usual, somewhere else). </li>
   <li> The history of the OKlibrary thus contains also all ("formalised")
    planning activities. </li>
   <li> Mailinglists are for more informal discussions (finding out about
    interests, "chatting" about the plans (which is to be avoided in the
    plans-files)). So mailinglists are for "pre-discussion", and,
    potentially, "meta-discussions"; but as soon things concretise, they
    should move to the plans-files (only there they fully connect to the
    system). </li>
   <li> To summarise, the planning process
    <ol>
     <li> is somewhat similar to "patchwork", which  comes in small
      pieces, </li>
     <li> is always in a somewhat well-defined state, </li>
     <li> and can be interrupted and continued as needed. </li>
    </ol>
    This might be especially true for core
    developers, while external developers might prefer a more traditional
    model, where only at the end the distilled work (using the
    "cherry-picking" method preferred for example by the Git developers)
    is submitted. However, after some initial period of getting used to
    the continuous process of the OKlibrary, also external developers are
    encouraged to use the "continuous model" (and not the "batch model").
   </li>
  </ol>
  
  
  <h3> The testing process </h3>
  
  <ul>
   <li> All code shall be accompanied by appropriate tests. </li>
   <li> Since most components are generic, "appropriate tests" means
    that actually test <em>functions</em> are to be provided, and this
    as part of the library. </li>
   <li> In this <a href="m4_SHELL(rel_aims_accu2006_talk_location)"> talk
    </a> more general information about the "higher order unit test system"
    provided by the OKlibrary can be found. </li>
  </ul>
