    <h1> The history of the OKlibrary </h1>
    

    <h2> General history </h2>

    <ul>
      <li> The <strong>initiation period</strong>: The "prehistory" is the development of the <code>OKsolver</code>:
        <ol>
          <li> On 5.3.1998, the development started, based on the <code>Boehm solver</code>. </li>
          <li> The active development of the <code>OKsolver</code> finished August 2001. (Later only
          extensions to the user interface have been carried out.) </li>
          <li> The solver participated in the SAT 2002 competition and won two first ("random"
            category) and two third ("handmade" category) prizes. </li>
        </ol>
        The original <code>OKsolver</code>, in refurbished form, is now part of the <code>OKlibrary</code>.
      </li>
      <li> The <strong>experimentation period</strong>: From 2002 to 2004, exploration of C++ started, and
        many experiments were carried out with regard to generic programming. </li>
      <li> The <strong>foundation period</strong>: February 2004 the EPSRC project "An algorithmic platform
        for efficient satisfiability-based problem solving" started, which created the foundations
        for the <code>OKlibrary</code>:
        <ol>
          <li> <a href="m4_SHELL(rel_history_epsrc_faststream_pdf_location)"> the grant proposal </a> (February 2003) </li>
          <li> <a href="m4_SHELL(rel_history_epsrc_6finalreport_pdf_location)"> the final report, official (short)
              version </a> (August 2007; with a few editorial changes) </li>
          <li> <a href="m4_SHELL(rel_history_epsrc_finalreport_pdf_location)"> the final report, unofficial, long version </a> (September 2007). </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li> The <strong>installment period</strong>: September 2007 version 0.2 of the <code>OKlibrary</code>
        was released. The basic foundation is laid, analogous to the planning of a new city, and until
        version 1.0 now (anticipated for the end of 2009) now the task is to implement (and extend) the plans,
        i.e., to "build the city". </li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h2> Version history </h2>

    <ol>
      <li> Version 0.2: 24.9.2007 (preparing the alpha-release planned
        for version 0.2.2, while the beta-release is planned for version 0.2.4,
        and the "official release" is planned for version 0.3). </li>
      <li> Version 0.2.1: 27.9.2008 (most of the basic targets for the alpha
        release are fulfilled, and now finishing and cleaning-up is needed).
      </li>
    </ol>


    <h3> Package history </h3>


    <ul>
      <li> The <a href="m4_SHELL(rel_history_release_history_output)">
          package-list </a> shows all package meta-data, with lines for every
        package-release, starting with
        <pre>
running-number version SHA date
        </pre>
        where "SHA" is the git-hash-value of the repository-history, followed by pairs
        <pre>
md5sum package-name
        </pre>
        of md5sum-hash-values of the three possible packages (minimal, normal, and full). </li>
      <li>  For the changes introduced with each package, see the
        <a href="PackageHistory.html">package history</a>. </li>
    </ul>
