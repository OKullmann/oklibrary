    <h1> Programming languages used by the OKlibrary </h1>

    Several formal languages are used in the library, for programming, mark-up
    and data description.


    <h2> General programming </h2>

    <ol>
      <li> <strong>C++</strong> is the main general purpose language. We adhere strictly to the
        C++ standard (in the 2003-version ("C++03"), which for all practical purposes is the same
        as the 1998-version ("C++98")), except that we include the anticipated 2009-version
        ("C++09").
        <p> Files containing C++ code either have the suffix <code>.hpp</code> (for header files)
          or the suffix <code>.cpp</code> (for implementation files).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li> <strong>C</strong> is used only for the old OKsolver. We adhere strictly to the
        1999-standard (<code>C99</code>).
        <p> Files containing C code either have the suffix <code>.h</code> (for header files)
          or the suffix <code>.c</code> (for implementation files).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li> The style of programming is <strong>modern C++</strong>, and not "just C with some
        add-ons" or the restricted point of view of object-orientation. However things should
        evolve, and especially at the start a good procedural C-style with extensions by
        concrete classes, exceptions and the standard library is recommended. </li>
    </ol>
    Programming languages like Perl or Python are not supported (they are considered as
    "false programming languages", in reality scripting languages for small jobs, but inflated to
    appear as "real programming languages"). For the purposes of prototyping we support
    languages from the realm of computer algebra (see below).


    <h2> System programming </h2>

    <ol>
      <li> <strong>Make</strong> is the system for the build system, and the associated programming
          language is accordingly the main programming language for the build system.
          <p> Files containing make-programs are either called <code>Makefile</code>, or have
            the suffix <code>.mak</code> (while the name <code>makefile</code> is only
            used for deprecated makefiles).
          </p>
      </li>
      <li> <strong>Bash</strong> or, more precisely, the associated programming language,
        is the programming language for system programming, used for
        meta-programs in the build-system, and for application test programs.
        <p> Files containing Bash programs are not distinguished by a special naming
          convention, but by their starting line <code>#!/bin/bash</code>. </p>
       </li>
    </ol>
    We consider Bash as a "true scripting language", which is used for relative short and easy
    programs. The use of Bash together with the Unix/Linux command line tools is unavoidable,
    and then the effort to learn for example Perl is wasted time (besides the point,
    that the character of Perl as the "private language of Larry" was finally to appalling
    for OK).

    <p>
    The Make-system appears old-fashioned, but its full power, based on its Lisp-like
    character, is not reached by any of the more modern system, while this power is
    essential for a holistic library like the OKlibrary. </p>


    <h2> Documentation </h2>

    <ol>
      <li> <strong>Doxygen</strong> (together with the associated mark-up language)
        is the system used for the extraction of documentation from
        source code, and also for writing general documentation which is closely
        related to programming details.

        XXX in C/C++ files XXX docus files
      </li>
      <li> <strong>XHTML</strong> in its strict form XXX for general overview and linking
        pages XXX
        <p> <code>.html</code> XXX</p>
      </li>
      <li> <strong>Latex</strong> is used for general ("conceptual") documentation. XXX
        <p> <code>.tex</code> and <code>.bib</code> </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Macro extensions XXX

    Documentation for the <code>docus</code>-system is close to actual code, and thus we employ
    also here the Doxygen system (even for programming languages where Doxygen doesn't support yet
    adding documentation to the code itself).

    XHTML in its strict form prevents the direct usage of formatting specification, which supports
    the maxim "First content, then form",


    <h2> Configuration languages </h2>

    The configuration system for the OKlibrary is based on makefiles. Configuration files
    for Doxygen and Apache are under source control (each with their own syntax), and also
    allow macro extensions XXX


    <h2> Computer algebra languages </h2>

    <ol>
      <li> <strong>Maxima</strong> (associated with <code>CLisp</code>) represents the "easiest" level
        of programming, without concern for type structures and refined algorithms. XXX
        <p> <code>.maxima</code> XXX </p>
      </li>
      <li> <strong>Axiom</strong> with associated language <strong>Aldor</strong> represents an
        intermediate level, considering type and concept hierarchies, but not being concerned
        with construction/destruction of objects, and also ignoring the fine details of
        adapting algorithms and data structures. XXX
        <p> extension ??? </p>
      </li>
      <li> Mupad was used, but since it is unfortunately no longer publically available, it was
        deprecated. Files with Mupad code have the suffix <code>.mup</code>. </li>
    </ol>


    <h2> Specification and proof assistants </h2>

    <ol>
      <li> <strong>Coq</strong> XXX
    </ol>


    <h2> SAT and other problem instances </h2>

    <ol>
      <li> <strong>Dimacs</strong> XXX
        <p> <code>.cnf</code> </p>
      </li>
    </ol>


    <h2> Other data formats </h2>

    <ol>
      <li> Text files in general do not follow specific naming conventions (in some cases,
        systematically <code>.txt</code> is used, but not in general). </li>
    </ol>
