  \brief Plans for the main local page on external sources


  \todo Links
  <ul>
   <li> Fill the "ready?"-columns. </li>
   <li> Fill the "installation page"-column. </li>
   <li> A special dedicated link-symbol (created by a style-sheet) perhaps
   would be better (to be used where now "click" appears). </li>
   <li> DONE See
   "Install configuration system:Also all links to ExternalSources-docs need to be relativised"
   in Buildsystem/Html/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> Make all install-pages-links relative : DONE </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Boost-documentation
  <ul>
   <li> We should make available documentation for all supported versions.
   (This is useful for transition periods.) But the main documentation is
   for the recommended version (the rest is provided by links). </li>
   <li> Include documentation for version 1_34_1: DONE
    <ol>
     <li> DONE (so well, seems somewhat better now) 
     15 of the 16 pages are loaded quickly, while the last takes very long. ?? </li>
     <li> Use the recommended version number. DONE </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE Create Local/plans/ExternalSources.hpp, and move relevant todos there. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo GCC-documentation
  <ul>
   <li> Include documentation for version 4.2.0 (make sure that everything
   is linked).
    <ol>
     <li> Find all the root-pages. </li>
     <li> Use the recommended version number. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> We should make available documentation for all supported versions.
   However the main documentations should be for the recommended version,
   while for the other pages we provide links. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Further documentation
  <ul>
   <li> R </li>
   <li> Coq </li>
   <li> Sage </li>
   <li> GMP </li>
  </ul>
