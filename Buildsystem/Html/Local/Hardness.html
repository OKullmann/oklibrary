    <h1> "Good" SAT representations </h1>


   <ul>
      <li> This page gives an overview of investigations into "good" SAT representations:</a>
      </li>
      <li> See also the
        <a href="http://cs.swan.ac.uk/~csmg/Hardness/">
          project webpage
        </a>.
      </li>
      <li> Relevant modules within the OKlibrary:
        <ul>
          <li> In module
            <em>Experimentation/Investigations/BooleanFunctions</em>
            we document our investigations into representations
            of boolean functions.
          </li>
          <li> Good representations for cryptographic ciphers:
            <ul>
              <li> In module
                <em>Experimentation/Investigations/Cryptography</em>
                we document our investigations into translations of
                cryptographic ciphers such as AES and DES.
              </li>
              <li> In module
                <em>ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology </em>
                we provide functions at Maxima-level related to cryptographic ciphers. </li>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> In module
            <em>Satisfiability/Reductions</em>
            we provide tools for computing reductions such as
            (generalised-)unit-clause-propagation.
          </li>
          <li> There are also various C++ implementations of tools and generators. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2> Hardness and boolean function representations </h2>

    <ul>
      <li> The notion of hardness for unsatisfiable clause-sets was originally introduced in
        <a href="http://cs.swan.ac.uk/~csoliver/papers.html#GenH1999">
          Investigating a general hierarchy of polynomially decidable classes of CNF's based on short tree-like resolution proofs
        </a>
        and generalised in
        <a href="http://cs.swan.ac.uk/~csoliver/papers.html#UpLoB2004">
           Upper and lower bounds on the complexity of generalized resolution and generalized constraint satisfaction problems
        </a>.
      </li>
      <li> See
        <a href="http://cs.swan.ac.uk/~csoliver/Artikel/2012_Leicester.pdf"> slides </a>
        for a talk OK gave in the
        <a href="http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/computer-science/news/researchevents/external/towards-a-theory-of-good-sat-representations">
          Computer Science Seminar (Leicester)
        </a>
        May 2012 on initiating a theory of "good SAT representations", as a kind of "knowledge representation for SAT solvers" with the notion of hardness as a theoretical tool.
      </li>
      <li> A recent report is
        <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6529">
          Generalising unit-refutation completeness and SLUR via nested input resolution
        </a>.
      </li>
      <li> The main topic of this report is:
        <ul>
          <li> The development of a systematic approach towards classes interesting for the area of knowledge compilation for the clausal entailment problem, as well as towards providing "soft" ("good") target classes for SAT translation. </li>
          <li> In particular, we develop a hierarchy UC_k of generalised unit-refutation complete clause-sets and show that this is exactly the same as a natural generalisation of the SLUR formulas. </li>
          <li> We also consider the problem of constructing "irredundant" clause-sets in UC_k, showing that:
            <ul>
              <li> For 2-CNF, strong minimisations are possible in polynomial time; </li>
              <li> For (very special) Horn clause-sets, minimisation is NP-complete. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2> Good representations in cryptography </h2>

    <ul>
      <li> The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">
          Advanced Encryption Standard
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">
          Data Encryption Standard
        </a>
        are popular encryption ciphers. </li>
      <li> We try to find good translations of AES and DES by translating the components of the ciphers using representations with low hardness (see above). </li>
      <li> Initial investigations were conducted in
        <a href="http://cs.swan.ac.uk/~csmg/Hardness/2011_CPPerugia.pdf">
          Towards a better understanding of hardness
        </a>
