Timing results/discussions for Random/TimingBernoulli12

This picture is consistent over the three platforms:
 - For the profiling it is important that all functions are run, otherwise
   computations can become much worse.Profiling yields a speed-up of say 20% on - This is what the option "-p" shall achieve.
 - It seems to yield something, say 10%, but can't undo the bad compilation
   which comes from just "packaging" the code, and adding some unrelated
   options.
 - The latter slowdown can be as bad as 50% (on csverify).


It is also surprising that adding just one small test to the generation
slows it down by ~ 10%: the generation should be a much more involved
computation, and so the effect of adding this test should be smaller?
Apparently the computation of g() is very fast, so that such a small addition
matters. Or it is the compilation.
