TODOS:

0 As a first step towards Todo 1, the output-object "out", currently
  of type std::ofstream, should be put into a proper class, so that
  the code starting with the declaration of out, and finishing with "index++",
  is captured.
  - The constructor takes arguments argc, argv, index (via reference), plus
    the default-filename.
  - The object offers access to filename and out.

1 Different verbosity levels, and handling of p-line
  - The following outlines proposed changes (to be discussed with AS, OZ).
  - Basically, using prefixes "-" or "--" to filenames to control output
    of comments and p-line.
  - Using "cout" instead of "-cout" as currently.
  - A prefix "-" for "cout" or "FILENAME" shall mean "no comments".
  - Additional one or two postfixes, separated by commas, for
    changing the p-line: first argument for n, second for c, with
    prefix "+" for addition, "-" for subtraction, and no prefix for
    replacement.
  - E.g. "-cout" shall mean without comments, while "-cout,+10" means
    also without comments, and additionally adding 10 to the n-value.
  - "--" shall mean without comments and without p-line.
  - Default filenames are not affected by such prefixes (they should be
    simple and stable).
  - This shall be a new standard for all such generators.
  - These options are not "observable", and thus are not encoded into the
    seeds.

Extended plans (according to e-email from 27.8.2020):

There are four "channels":
1. the output-message
2. the comments
3. the p-line
4. the clauses.

In the case of (D)QCNF we have five of them:
4. the quantifier-prefix
5. the clauses.

When the output string starts with "+" or "-", then 4 resp. 5 leading
such symbols, if existing (if not, then their default-values are used),
are taken, switching on or off the channels (independently).

Additionally, if the final symbol of the output-string is "]", then it
is assumed there is a trailing "[x,y]" (if not it's a syntax-error),
where x,y are unsigned integers with a possible prefix "+" or "-": these
two numbers set resp. adjust the p-line.

While for the "+-"-prefix we only need the initial part (possibly
empty), for the "[]"-postfix we need to have both numbers.

If we switch off the clause-part, then computations are only done as
much as is needed to compute the other parts (that might be a bit
tricky, but should be doable).

So we have for the output part the syntax

 [+- prefix]NAME[x,y suffix]

where NAME can be empty (thus using the default name), "cout" (standard
output), or anything else.

For example if one wants to have just the p-line on standard output:

  --+-cout

If we want to have that into the default file:

  --+-

And if we want to have that into file "XYZ":

  --+-XYZ

If we want the default file, with 5 clauses added to the p-line:

  [+0,+5]

Or if we want to replace the values of the p-line (with default file):

  [123,456]

Note that for the default file the default-+- prefix is "++++", while
otherwise it is "-+++".

So if we want the default file, with 2 variable substracted, no clauses
added, and no message:

  -[-2,+0]


If we have disabled the p-line in the prefix, but have the x,y-suffix,
then the suffix re-enables the p-line (since the instruction is read
from left to right).

It seems we don't need to have the possibility of NAME="nil".


2 Should all output-options influence the seeds?
  - The two main option-dimensions, "sorting" and "renaming", are
    "observable", and thus encoded.
  - Is this reasonable for the renaming-dimensions (with its three options)?
    Seems so, since the behaviour of SAT-solvers might depend on it.

3 For building the program one has to allow also building outside of
the context of the OKlibrary. Then the Git-id is just hardcoded.
