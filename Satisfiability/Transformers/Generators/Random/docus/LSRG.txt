Example usage for creating two latin squares of order 10, with a
seed-sequence "0" (using the debug-version):

Random> ./LSRG_debug 10 2 0
 ...

 ...

Details:

The program implements the Jacobson-Matthews algorithm for generating random Latin
squares. This algorithm was published in:
Mark T. Jacobson, Peter Matthews. Generating uniformly distributed random latin
squares // Journal of Combinatorial Designs. 1996.

The main program's inputs are N (order) and M (the required number of random Latin
squares). M times a random Latin square of order N is generated as follows:

At the beginning a Latin square of order N is constructed. It can be done via
various approaches, by now it is done by constructing a multiplication table for a
cyclic group.

Order N is considered, and {0,1,...,N-1} are the possible values of a Latin
square's cells. The row and column-sum of a Latin square is thus
  S = 1 + ... + N-1 = N * (N-1) / 2.

The condition on cells is relaxed, allowing an improper Latin square as follows:
1) Possible entries are from V:={0,...,N-1} union {(a,b,c)}, where
     (a,b,c) in V^3, a < b, c notin {a,b}.
2) The special entry occurs at most once.
3) If a row or column does not contain a special entry, then the (ordinary) values
   are exactly those from V (all occurring, none twice).
4) If a row or column contains (a,b,c), then there are two entries c,
   and the N-3 values of the remaing cells are exactly those from V - {a,b,c}.
   (Thus when interpreting "(a,b,c)" as contributing "a+b-c" to a sum, then every
    row- and every column-sum equals S.)

A move consists of identifying a suitable 2 * 2 subtable and modifying its cells.
As a result, a proper Latin square can become improper and vice versa.

The program performs N^3 such moves, then if an improper Latin square is obtained,
additional moves are done until a proper Latin square is appeared.
