# Computing the sizes of conflict-graph and derived biclique-compatibility graph



# USAGE:

# DirGraphSizes QBF2BCC

# TODOS:

# 1. Perhaps if file E or cE already exists, skip directory?
#    - Perhaps that should be an option.
# 2. We need a parallel mode; easiest just to parallelise on
#    all directories.
#    - Better a C++ program.
#      Just storing all tasks in a vector.
