Preparation for amo, alo, eo:

For literals x_1, ..., x_m, m >= 0 (pairwise different underlying variables)
the prime-representations have parameters:

  amo: binom(m,2)
  alo: 1
  eo : 1+binom(m,2)


A) UNREDUCED

The number of primary ls-variables
  enc(i,j,eps,p)
is

  nls = k * N^3.

There are no auxiliary ls-variables (due to using the prime-representation
of amo).

The full representation is fully symmetric for the three dimensions
  rows, columns, values.
For each dimension there are N^2 combinations to consider, for each
combination an eo over N literals.

That makes for the number of clauses

  cls = k * 3 * N^2 * (1+binom(N,2))
      = 3/2 * k * N^2 * (N^2-N+2)
      ~ 3/2 k N^4.

Here "~" refers to asymptotic equality (the limit of the quotient is 1).
The simplified term is obtained by (in the Maxima system):
  simplify_t(mols_unred_cls(N,k));
