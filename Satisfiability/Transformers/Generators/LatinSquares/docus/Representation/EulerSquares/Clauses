A) UNREDUCED

The clauses for the euler-squares are:

 (a) The defining equivalences ("euler-equivalences")

       enc(i,j,{x,y},{p,q}) <-> enc(i,j,x,p) && enc(i,j,y,q);

     which yields 3 * N^4 * binomial(k,2) clauses.

 (b) For all {x,y} and all {p,q} ("euler-amo")

       amo for all i, j : enc({i,j,{x,y},{p,q}).

     Here the "sequential command-encoding" is used, which uses (roughly),
     for amo over m literals:
      - m/2 auxiliary (new) variables
      - 3m clauses.

That makes

  ces ~ 6 * N^4 * binomial(k,2) = 6 * npes

  naux ~ 1/2 * N^4 * binomial(k,2) = 1/2 * npes.

In total:

  c ~ 3 k*N^2*(1+binomial(N,2)) + 6 N^4*binomial(k,2).


B) REDUCED

Also as before, we can use

  ces ~ 6 npes

since the main bulk is given by the 3 clauses for the euler-equivalences
per primary es-variable, and, as above, by the aggregated amo over these
variables, which make again 3*npes clauses.
