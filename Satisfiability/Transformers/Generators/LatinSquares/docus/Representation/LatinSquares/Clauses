A) UNREDUCED

The clauses for the latin squares are
  eo ("exactly one") for the fields, rows, columns,
  using the representation by prime clauses.

For enc(i,j,eps,p) that means fixing p and two of (i,j,eps), and
quantifying over the third parameter.

That makes

  cls = 3 * k * N^2 * (1+binomial(N,2)).
