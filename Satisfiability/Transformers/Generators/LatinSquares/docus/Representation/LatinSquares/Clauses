A) UNREDUCED

The clauses for the latin squares are
  eo ("exactly one") for the fields, rows, columns,
  using the representation by prime clauses.

For enc(i,j,eps,p) that means fixing p and two of (i,j,eps), and
quantifying over the third parameter.

That makes

  cls = 3 * k * N^2 * (1+binomial(N,2)).


Remarks:

This is the same as "strong_ls(N)" in the older Generators/LatinSquares.mac.
 - The direct encoding (for each value a boolean variable) is natural, since
   it allows easily the interaction of different constraints.
 - The prime-representations (no auxiliary variables, all prime clauses) at
   least for the small anticipated N seems best.
 - Expressing amo and alo seems best, again at least for small N.
