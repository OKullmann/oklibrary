I OPTIONS ON EULER-EO

The second option determining the clauses of the translation, now only for
k >= 2, has the possibilities:
 - L0  : none
 - Lv  : values
 - Lp  : pairs
 - Lb  : values_pairs ("both")
 - Lpu : pairs_uep
 - Lbu : values_pairs_uep.

This concerns ALO ("at-least-one") in two forms for the es-variables:
 - "values": each field (i,j) of the euler-square has one of the N^2 values
             {x,y}
 - "pairs": each pair {x,y} is used in some field (i,j) of the euler-square.
This forms thus add N^2 many long clauses, with N^2 literals for the full
form (for the reduced form roughly "N" is replaced by "N-1").

"uep" means "unique extension-property", and strengthens euler-amo by adding
a clause per auxiliary variable v: the amo-translation (alone) uses
implications
  a or b or c -> v
(which yields 3 clauses), which has not uep in case a=b=c=0 (then v can be
0 or 1), and so "uep" adds the reverse
  v -> a or b or c.
"Lpu" uses then the final auxiliary variables v to express ALO (which yields
a clause of length 4 instead of N^2).
"Lbu" additionally to Lpu uses Lv (so we get again the long clauses).

The estimation ces ~ 6 npes has to be updated for the uep-forms, since
here we get 0.5 * npes many additional clauses, and thus here we use

  ces ~ 6.5 npes.


II OPTIONS ON EULER-EQUIVALENCES

The third option, again only for k >= 2, determines the form of the
euler-equivalences:
 - fE: full
 - pE: positive.

The first form uses the equivalences, as above, while the second form
uses only

  enc(i,j,{x,y},{p,q}) <- enc(i,j,x,p) && enc(i,j,y,q)

where "positive" refers to the positive occurrence of the Euler-variable
(while the two cancelled (binary) clauses yield negative occurrences).


III OPTIONS ON LS-EO

The fourth option determines the form of the alo/amo/eo-constraints for
the single latin squares:
 - fP: full
 - mP: minimal

Here "P" stands for prime clauses, that is, for alo/amo/eo exactly the
prime clauses are used. With
 - "full", eo for fields+rows+columns is used,
 - while with "minimal", alo for fields and amo for rows+columns is used.
