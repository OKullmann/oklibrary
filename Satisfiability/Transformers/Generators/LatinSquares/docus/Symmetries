I   Symmetries

    Given a solution, one can:
     (S) for each ls's individually permute the symbols
     (R) For all ls's together permute the rows.
     (C) For all ls's together permute the columns.

    The basic symmetry consists of bringing a solution into some "standard
    form" by applying operations (S),(R),(C).

    So we can achieve a standardised first row for each ls by (S).
    And then one can standardise the first column of ls 0 by (R).

II  Extend symmetry-breaking (according to CB):

     - For k >= 2 one can partially reduce the second Latin
       square (with index k=1).

     - In column 0 one can assume that row i contains an entry <=
       i+1, which fixes the (1,0) entry to 2 and the (n-2,0) entry to n-1.

     - For example, to force 2 into the (1,0) entry when x is the current
       (1,0) entry: swap the labels of x and 2 in the first and second Latin
       squares, then swap the rows and columns containing x and 2 in the
       Latin squares.

     - The same idea works whenever the (i,0) entry of the second Latin
       square is > i+1.
