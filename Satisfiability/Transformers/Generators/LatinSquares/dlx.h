// The 'dlx_t' type is an opaque pointer that holds an instance of the exact
// cover problem represented as a sparse matrix of 0s and 1s. The library
// provides a function that solves the instance using
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links[the DLX algorithm].
//
// Row and column numbers are 0-indexed.
