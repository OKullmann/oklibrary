# USAGE:

# ./NLSRG N p seeds

# creates the CNF for a latin square of order N, with round(N^3 * p)
# many variables randomly set to false (that is, blocking values).
# Output to standard output.

# Example:
# ./NLSRG 15 0.6 t | minisat-2.2.0 /dev/stdin
# creating a partial latin square of order 15, with 0.6 * 15^3 = 2025 many
# values forbidden (randomly chosen), and evaluating the CNF by minisat.
