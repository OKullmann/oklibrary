# Reads ExpQueens-output from standard input, printing the extracted numerical
# data together with a header (R table-style) to standard output.

# Read into R with e.g.
# E=read.table("File",header=TRUE)

# One optional argument is allowed:
# - if it is "header-only" then only the header is printed
# - otherwise (with one argument) only the data is printed.
# (If there is no argument, then both header and data are printed.)
