USAGE:

uses the built-in N (N=16 by default), and outputs statistics (see below).
floor((N+1)/2) parallel threads are used.
Via "-h" help-information is obtained, via "-v" version-information.

Use
 - "make SETN=-DNUMQUEENS=X" for compilation with N=X
 - "make SETBTYPES=-DBTYPES=0/1" for backtracking in recursive/non-recursive form.

More conveniently, use

> ./Call_QueensRUCPct [N=16] [bt=1]

for performing first the compilation with
 - NUMQUEENS = N
 - BTYPES = bt
and then running the program, output with an R-header and additional
performance data. E.g.

> ./Call_QueensRUCPct 15 1
N bt  sol nds uc r2s r2u cu  ut wt st pp mm
15 1  2279184 7995732 29812560 1248961 10966795 901275  0.54 1.85 0.00 342% 6752

Class Row implements one row of the board, while
XXX

The core function is DoubleSweep::ucp(Statistics&), which performs complete
row-unit-propagation, while for columns exactly the inconsistencies are
detected (i.e., empty column-clauses).


BUGS:

1. DONE All timings should be backed up (especially if they are new) by the
   corresponding log-data.
    - DONE OZ needs to add all the missing data.
    - DONE Such log entries needed to be commited in the same commit as the
      change to overview.
    - DONE The one entry we have for amd1 is incomplete: for the first time, it
      must contain all data.
    - DONE The entry for amd1, 0.18.14, in Overview is inconsistent with the log-
      entry.

2. DONE The change of version 0.18.19 shouldn't have been done, since it clearly
   makes runtime worse on the server.
    - DONE Times for N=19 are missing (especially crucial to judge the development).

3. DONE In recent commits, OZ appears with three different e-mails addresses in the
   Git-history: There should be exactly one.
    - This just needs to take care of the git-configuration for each machine.

4. DONE Timing results for version 0.18.17 are missing.
    - In commit 3cfef4d9f2f05d7f974f01ef3691902be04fd5c4 there was data
      entered in Overview.
    - This was then silently overwritten in commit
      fb68f8f33d459b6a80f72e0ed165ebeb7ab37a59 (this should not happen;
      and there is no indication about that in the commit-message).
    - Best to check all data, together with Bug No 1 above.

5. DONE In commit 801f7903ef93d884b69084b3c03ef52524abaaf3, information was
   lost without explanation of why removing it.
    - DONE Wrapping lower to -1 was problematic.
    - DONE bottom,top was beneficial on the server (the main machine), and thus
      likely needs to be retained.
    - DONE When commenting on runtime-developments, the corresponding
      version-numbers and the data used should be given (otherwise the
      argumentation can not be checked).

6.  DONE The style of the OKlibrary is to use complete sentences for
    commit-messages.
    - This is in line with the general philosophy of explicitness and
      precision.
    - It also emphasises that a commit should be as complete as possible.
      Currently the commits of OZ look a bit

TODOS:

-1. OK Replace std::is_pod_v by
      std::is_standard_layout_v and std::is_trivial_v
    since it's deprecated with C++20.
    - The moBst important aspect (for us) seems to be captured by
      std::is_trivially_copyable.
    - std:is_trivial adds requirements on construction.
    - The question is where this should be placed.
      DONE: for now placing the macro is_pod(X) into central places.


0. AB, OK Write tests (in the usual dedicated testfile).
    - The statistics need to be precisely determined for small cases (at least
      up to N=5) by hand.
    - Also the behaviour of UCP needs to be exactly specified and tested.
    - Start test-program. DONE
    - Also application-tests are needed; see GenericSAT, or better,
      Quantification/DQCNF.

1. OK, AB See basic todos in Board.hpp, Rows.hpp.

2. AB Document the various concepts (rows, extended rows, boards).

3. OK After 0-2, version 1.0 is reached.

4. AB The node-counts need to be compared to that of the complete approach
   ("TCA2": GenericSAT, standard propagation, FirstRow-heuristics), and that of
   the restricted approach ("TCA1": NQueens.cpp).

5. OK, AB: Setting the two implementation-macros should be improved.
