# USAGE:

#   Call_QueensRUCPct [bt=0]

# compiles progr=Queens_RUCP_ct in both versions (optimised/debug),
# via "make -B", setting
# NUMQUEENS=N, BTYPES=bt,
# prints the R-header, then runs the program,
# and appends data on the run to the output-line:
#  - elapsed real time e (in seconds)
#  - total number U of CPU-seconds that the process spent in user mode
#  - total number S of CPU-seconds that the process spent in kernel mode
#  - percentage of the CPU that this job got, computed as (U + S) / e
#  - maximum resident set size of the process during its lifetime, in Kbytes.

# The variables (with their default values)
#  - progr = "Queens_RUCP_ct"
#  - progargs = ""
#  - header = "N rt ert bt  sol nds uc r2s r2u cu  ut wt st pp mm"
# can be set to different values on the command-line.
# To avoid printing the header, one sets header to 0, i.e.:

#   header=0 Call_QueensRUCPct ...

# Finally

#   Call_QueensRUCPct -header

# prints only the R-header (for Queens_RUCP_ct).
