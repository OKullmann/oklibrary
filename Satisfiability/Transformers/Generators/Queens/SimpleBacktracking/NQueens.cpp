  Started as copy from
  https://github.com/alenic/nqueens/commits/master
  ID f50264291093fe8529d143995ae9784f097d7ebf.

The basic idea is the same as explained at
  https://helloacm.com/n-queen-problem-in-back-tracing-bit-logics/
and indeed the same as the program from 2002 by Jeff Somers
  http://users.rcn.com/liusomers/nqueen_demo/nqueens.html

Variable numrows there is our size, lsb is next, bitfield is avail, mask
is all_columns. The array aQueenBitCol contains the values of our variable
column, aQueenBitPosDiag of fdiag, aQueenBitNegDiag of fantid.
An array is used there to simulate the recursion.
The additional aQueenBitRes there just represents the solution for printing.

  Version 1.1, 20.7.2019.

  Usage:

> ./qcount N

Output of the solution count and the number of nodes; e.g.

> ./qcount 8
92 615

That is, 92 solutions (nonattacking placements of 8 queens on the 8x8 board),
using 615 nodes in the backtracking tree.

For compilation the Makefile in the same directory as this file can be used.
It produces also the debugging-version "qcount_debug".
To set NMAX (maximal allowed value of N; default 64), use e.g.
> CXXFLAGS="-DNMAX=32" make


TODOS:

1. Update to C++17: DONE
2. Update makefile, and use the new framework (Environment.hpp).

3. Use signals (like the tawSolver), to show current counts.
4. Use futures for parallelisation.
5. Simulate the recursion by a stack (as done in Jeff Somers's original
   program, whose runtime is very similar to the runtime of this program
   (version 1.0)). OK doesn't expect a speed-up, but one can try.
