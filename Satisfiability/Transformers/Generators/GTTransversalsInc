# "GTTransversalsInc k n t file1 file 2" starts computing the transversal
# number of the hypergraph of arithmetic progressions of size k over 
# {p_1,...,p_n}, where t is the transversal number over {1,...,n-1} (thus the 
# transversal number for n is either t or t+1), and continues with n+1 and so
# on.
# The method is by adding the equality "transversal size = t" to
# the clauses representing the hyperedges, thus obtaining a SAT problem,
# solved then by Minisat2 (the current default; seems to be strongest on these 
# problems).
