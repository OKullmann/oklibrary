  \brief General plans on optimisation variants of (generalised) satisfiability


  \todo Update namespaces.


  \todo Create module MinOnes (or "WeightedSAT" ?)


  \todo Create module MaxSat.


  \todo DONE Create module MinSAT.
  <ul>
   <li> This is about finding a satisfying partial assignment
   using a minimal number of variables, a natural
   generalisation of finding a minimum size transversal
   of a hypergraph. </li>
  </ul>
