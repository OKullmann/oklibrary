  \brief Old module for components around the DP-procedure
  \deprecated


  \todo Further development
  <ul>
   <li> The central question is how much of this module is still of use?
   Perhaps not very much; but at least it could serve to establish the first
   "clues". </li>
   <li> In principle a module on Davis-Putnam-resolution is sensible, since
   it has many applications. </li>
   <li> See "Whatever remains of module DPv shall move here" in
   ProofSystems/Resolution/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> Is the name "DPv" right? </li>
   <li> If this module shall be further developed, then reactivate the tests
   and application-compilation. </li>
   <li> Move to module Resolution. DONE </li>
  </ul>
