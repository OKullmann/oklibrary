# Preparing processing of a command with an argument MEINDEX, which is
# run through 1, ..., N, storing the outputs, via producing a Makefile.



# USAGE:
# MExperiment N command

# where N is a natural number, and command is the string for execution:
#  - MEINDEX in command is replaced by 1, ..., N
#  - no further changes in command (as it is passed to the shell)
#  - it is the responsibility of the command to store appropriately the result
#    in Results/MEINDEX
#  - the calling-place of the command is within the experiment-directory.

# EXAMPLES: See docus/MExperiment.
