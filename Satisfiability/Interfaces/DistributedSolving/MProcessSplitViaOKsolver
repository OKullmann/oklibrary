# Preparing processing of a directory produced by SplitViaOKsolver,
# producing a Makefile.

# USAGE:
# MProcessSplitViaOKsolver SplitViaOKsolver_dir

# creates the experiment-directory "MProcess_splitviaoksolver-dirname_timestamp"
# (in the current directory) containing the files
#  - Log: general logging information (general information, and the runs of make)
#  - Environment: information on the computer environment
#  - instance: a symbolic link to the original instance-file
#  - Makefile: to be run
#  - SubinstanceStatistics: in R-format the collected data, as produced by
#    ExtractMinisat
#  and containing the directories:
#  - Instances: an symbolic link to (sub-)instances (partial assignments)
#    in the SplitViaOKsolver-directory
#  - Results: the targets (the same files, numbered 1, ..., number-cubes,
#    as in Instances) for the Makefile, where the extracts of the solver-runs
#    are stored).
# Furthermore Temp$i.cnf contains the instance (after application of the
# partial assignment) currently solved, and Temp$i.out contains the solver
# output of the last solved instance (these are temporary files, which are
# deleted after successful processing).

# By default the solver is minisat-2.2.0. To use a different solver, set
# variable "solver", for example

# solver="OKsolver_2002-O3-DNDEBUG" solver_args="-M -D10" ProcessSplitViaOKsolver XXX

# To run the default-solver with just additional parameters, for example a
# time-limit, use e.g. (here a time-limit of 20s is set)
#   solver_args="-cpu-lim=20" ProcessSplitViaOKsolver XXX

# Expected return-values of the solver are 0 (return without a result),
# 10 (sat) and 20 (unsat).

# Evaluation of the file SubinstanceStatistics (in R) via e.g.
# read_processsplit_minisat (for the default).

# The Makefile has the following targets:
#  - run : beginrun runjobs endrun
#  - begin/endrun: logging
#  - runjobs: run the solver on the subinstances (cubes)
#  - extract: puts the data under Results into SubinstanceStatistics,
#    and outputs the number of unsatisfiable, satisfiable and unknown
#    subinstances, together with their total run-times
#  - transfer : run, followed by extract
#  - all : run transfer
#  - clean: rm the results under Results
#  - cleanall: rm also SubinstanceStatistics.
# The order and indexing of the cubes is as output by the OKsolver (different
# from ProcessSplitViaOKsolver).

# Run with
#   make
# for sequential mode, and with
#   make -j M
# for M parallel processes (just "make -j" uses unrestricted parallelism).


# Used tools from the OKlibrary:
# script SelectExtractionTool
#   e.g. for minisat-2.2.0: ExtractMinisat
# program ApplyPass-O3-DNDEBUG (in Makefile).

# TODOS:
# 1. Target "extract", for counting the instances, should skip
#    initial comments and the header-line.
# 2. An option is needed to ignore the return-code of the solver.
# 3. An option is needed to run RemoveVarGaps on the instance
#    before solving:
#     - Via another option the renaming is stored.
# 4. An option is needed to just store the output in the Results-file,
#    without using an extraction-tool.
#     - Then something needs to be done to target "transfer" (which currently
#       is automatically invoked, and runs the extraction-tool.
#     - Perhaps extraction-tool is then the empty string, and in this
#       case it is not used.
