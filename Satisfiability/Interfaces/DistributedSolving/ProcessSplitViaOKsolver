# Processing of a directory produced by SplitViaOKsolver.
# Two modes of usage:

# ProcessSplitViaOKsolver SplitViaOKsolver_dir

# creates the experiment-directory "Process_splitviaoksolver-dirname_timestamp"
# (in the current directory) containing the files
#  - Log: general logging information
#  - Parameter: the version of this script, the splitviaoksolver-directory,
#     the created experiment-directory, and the solver used
#  - Environment: information on the computer environment
#  - current_subinstance: starting with 1, the index of the next sub-instance
#    to be solved (see below for the order of processing)
#  - SubinstanceStatistics: in R-format the collected data, as produced by
#    ExtractMinisat, with a running number and i, npa and d added at the
#    front, the index of the sub-problem, the (total) number of variables in
#    the partial assignment, and the number of decisions in it.
#  - If a satisfiable sub-instance was found, then in file
#    SatisfyingAssignments for each satisfiable sub-instance one has a line
#    "index original-index" with the index for this processing and the index
#    w.r.t. the original creation by OKsolver.
#  - Upon completion, the file Result is created which contains whether
#    the instance was determined satisfiable or unsatisfiable, and the total
#    running time (the sum of process times for all processes involved).
# Furthermore Temp.cnf contains the instance (after application of the
# partial assignment) currently solved, and Temp.out contains the solver
# output of the last solved instance.
# The order of processing is not as output by the OKsolver, but as determined
# in file SplitViaOKsolver_dir/Data, which lists the instances in order 1,...,
# number-of-subinstances (cubes), followed by the index of the partial
# assignment (as in subdirectory Instances).

# The second form
# ProcessSplitViaOKsolver SplitViaOKsolver_dir Process_dir

# uses the already created Process_dir (created by a previous invocation
# of that script) to continue an interrupted processing.
# For the final running time, as stored in Result, currently only the last
# run is used.

# By default the solver is minisat-2.2.0. To use a different solver, set
# variable "solver", for example

# solver="OKsolver_2002-O3-DNDEBUG" solver_args="-M -D10" ProcessSplitViaOKsolver XXX [YYY]

# To run the default-solver with just additional parameters, for example a
# time-limit, use e.g. (here a time-limit of 20s is set)
#   solver_args="-cpu-lim=20" ProcessSplitViaOKsolver XXX [YYY]
# This environment-variable needs also to be set when re-starting
# ProcessSplitViaOKsolver (via using the second argument).

# Expected return-values of the solver are 0 (return without a result),
# 10 (sat) and 20 (unsat).

# After abortion via SIGINT, for further continuation potentially files
# SubinstanceStatistics and current_subinstance should be manipulated,
# possibly undoing the result of the last subinstance(s) if the yielded
# results "2" (undetermined). A more robust way of stopping the process seems
#   pkill -TERM -P pid
# where the process-id ("pid") can be obtained from the Log-file.

# Evaluation of the file SubinstanceStatistics (in R) via e.g.
# read_processsplit_minisat (for the default).

# Used tools from the OKlibrary:
# script SelectExtractionTool
# e.g. for minisat-2.2.0: ExtractMinisat
# program ApplyPass-O3-DNDEBUG.
