# USAGE:

# ProcessRandomDQCNFExperiment quantifiers dependencies clauses options

# creates a directory
# EP_DQCNF_${generator_call}_${reduction_call}_${squeezedparams}_${timestamp}
# which contains a Makefile ready to perform the (continuous) experimentation.
# For using QBRG, which doesn't have dependencies, use "" for this argument.

# Variables for customisation, and their default-values:

#  - generator_call = DQBRG
#  - reduction_call = AAnalysis
#  - timestamp = UNIX-time in nanoseconds

# TODOS:
# 0. This script should be called "CreateRandomDQCNFExperiment".
# 1. Write R-function for reading, with specified types of columns.
# BUGS:
# 1. See data/Random/DQBRG/t6/k3/e1-3/n800/c1600
#    The output of AAnalysis had no time for the first SAT-check, twice.
#    Running AAanalysis alone, the problem did not appear.
#    Perhaps somewhere a race-conditions.
#     - Made filenames more specific to run, as a first measure. DONE
