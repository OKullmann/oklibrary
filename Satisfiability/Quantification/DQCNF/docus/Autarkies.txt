Documentation for AutarkiesL1.cpp


  USAGE:

> AutarkiesL1 [input] [file-output] [log] [conformity-level=n] [log-level=0]

A parameter can only be used iff all parameters to the left of it are
specified.

For the input, either a filename or "-cin" (standard input, the default)
can be used.

For the two outputs, file- and log-output, the default is standard output.
Other possibilities are:
 - a filename (possibly equal for both)
 - "-cout" for standard output
 - "-cerr" for standard error
 - "-clog" for standard log
 - "-nil" for no output.
For log also "=" is possible, which is then the same as file-output.

Conformity-level "g" (for "general") admits c-lines and consecutive/empty
a/e-lines in the dependency-section, and also allows empty clauses.
For example:

> echo -e "p cnf 0 0\na 0\na 0\ne 0\ne 0" | ./AutarkiesL1_debug -cin -nil -nil g
> echo $?
0

while at log-level n for two a-lines and two e-lines we need to have
four variables:

> echo -e "p cnf 4 0\na 1 0\ne 2 0\na 3 0\ne 4 0" | ./AutarkiesL1_debug -cin -cout -nil vs
c Program AutarkiesL1_debug: version 0.6.30, 26.3.2020.
c Input: -cin
p cnf 0 1
0

Level "s" (for "strict") disallows clauses without existential variables
("pseudo-empty" clauses).

The default of log-level is 0, while
log-level "1" has the original input shown, and
log-level "2" has additionally information on the encoding in
the comments-section of the translated problem.
