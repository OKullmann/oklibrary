# Preparing processing instances from a directory by a solver
# producing a Makefile.

# USAGE:
# RunEuler dirname

# creates the experiment-directory "RunEuler_solver_dirname_timestamp"
# (in the current directory) containing the files
#  - Log: general logging information (general information, and the runs of make)
#  - Environment: information on the computer environment
#  - Makefile: to be run
#  - SubinstanceStatistics: in R-format the collected data, as produced by
#  and containing the directories:
#  - Instances: an symbolic link to instances in the given directory
#  - Results: the targets for the Makefile, where the extracts of the
#    Euler-runs are stored)
# Furthermore $instance.out contains the solver output of the solved instance
# (these are temporary files, which are deleted after successful processing).

# To give all Euler parameters, set variable "solver", for example

# solver="Euler 0 0 la,val -sol,-head dom 2,3,4,5"

# By default the time-limit for running the solver is 86400 seconds,
# it can be changed by setting variable "solver_prefix", for example

# solver_prefix="timeout --signal=SIGINT 2000"

# To run Euler with mentioned parameters with time-limit of 20 seconds in the directory
# "data/CNF", use
#   solver="Euler 0 0 la,val -sol,-head dom 2,3,4,5"
#     solver_prefix="timeout --signal=SIGINT 20" RunEuler "/data/benchmakrs/"

# The Makefile has the following targets:
#  - run : beginrun runjobs endrun
#  - begin/endrun: logging
#  - runjobs: run the solver on the instances
#  - extract: puts the data under Results into SubinstanceStatistics,
#    and outputs the number of unsatisfiable, satisfiable and unknown
#    subinstances, together with their total run-times
#  - transfer : run, followed by extract
#  - all : run transfer
#  - clean: rm the results under Results
#  - cleanall: rm also SubinstanceStatistics.
# The order and indexing of the instances is as output by the solver.

# Run with
#   make
# for sequential mode, and with
#   make -j M
# for M parallel processes (just "make -j" uses unrestricted parallelism).
