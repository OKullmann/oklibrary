# Generates benchmarks for the Euler square completion problem of order 7.
# In the first Latin square, m random givens are added and then the
# symmetry breaking is applied. In the second Latin square, the first row
# is given due to the symmetry breaking.
# The benchmarks files have the following names:
# bIJCAI22_7_i : 1 <= i <= 1000
# where i is the benchmark index (and seed for LSRG).

# BUGS:
# 0. DONE (copyright, script_name, version_number, exit are provided)
#    Follow the standard for bash-scripts:
#  - see the older bash-scripts.
# 1. By default the output must go to standard output:
#  - here that could be achieved by using the case that no
#    command-line input is given;
#  - but it's safer to ask for one special input..
# 2. The above text needs update.
