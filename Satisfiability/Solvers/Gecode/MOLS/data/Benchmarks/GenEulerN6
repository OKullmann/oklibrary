# Generates benchmarks for the Euler square completion problem of order 6.
# The symmetry breaking is fully applied to the first Latin square,
# and partially to the second one.
# The benchmarks files have the following names:
# bIJCAI22_6_i : 0 <= i <= 6.
# where i is the number of given cells (from the symmetry breaking)
# in the second square.

# BUGS:
# 0. DONE (copyright, script_name, version_number, exit are provided)
#    Follow the standard for bash-scripts:
#  - see the older bash-scripts.
# 1. By default the output must go to standard output:
#  - here that could be achieved by using the case that no
#    command-line input is given;
#  - but it's safer to ask for one special input.
