# Generate benchmarks of the Euler square completion problem of order 8
# bIJCAI22_8_i_j : 1 <= i <= 1000, 0 <= j <= 8.
# where i is the benchmark instance (and seed for LSRG), while j is the
# number of given cells (from the symmetry breaking) in the second square.

# BUGS:
# 0. Follow the standard for bash-scripts:
#  - see the older bash-scripts.
# 1. By default the output must go to standard output:
#  - here that could be achieved by using the case that no
#    command-line input is given;
#  - but it's safer to ask for one special input..
# 2. We have two benchmark-sets, for two m's:
#  - That should be a new, first parameter.
#  - The value of this parameter could be just 0 (m=64), and 1 (m=35),
#  - since the generator is there for exactly the benchmarks from the paper.
#  - Though one also might accommodate the benchmarks for the journal-version,
#    and then just using the m-value would make sense.
