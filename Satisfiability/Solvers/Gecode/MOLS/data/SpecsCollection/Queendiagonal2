# Counts for N >= 2:
# 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0
# >= 1

# Best seems dom+binbr+mindegdom.
# As with Pandiagonal, "rred" seems to make decision harder.
# N=12 (satisfiable) is already hard here for sat-decision
# (with and without rred).

# The current data is identical with Pandiagonal2 -- does this hold in general?
