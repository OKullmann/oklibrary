# Number of reduced diagonal+antidiagonal Latin squares of order n
#
# Counts for n >= 2:
# 0, 0, 2, 8, 128, 171200; 7447587840
#
# The counts of LSdiag are obtained from that via multiplication by N!.
#
# As with LSdiag, max-deg/dom-var seems the best variable-selection,
# and domain-prop best node-wise, while values-prop best time-wise.
# N=8 on csltok2:
# MOLS> ./gcMols 8 data/SpecsCollection/LSdiagrred "" count "dom,val" maxdegdom "" "" > OUT7diagrred &
# domain-prop max-deg/dom-var bin-branch-min 7447587840 39139.913 206634706490 289249664 15473675007 41
# values-prop max-deg/dom-var bin-branch-min 7447587840 39604.654 187583869572 4971983265 24839142209 43
# So apparently here domain-prop pays off, and the best combination also
# time-wise (by a small margin) is (domain-prop, max-deg/dom-var).

# Comparison with laMols of version 0.2.1 (without pruning):

# On N=14, la produced 80 nodes vs 117 on gc.
# On N=15, la has produced nodes vs 140 on gc.
# Maybe on this instance maxdeg is better than tau?
# Or maybe the reason is default values of weights?
# Should be investigated further.
