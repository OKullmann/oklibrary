# Number of reduced diagonal+antidiagonal Latin squares of order n
#
# Counts for n >= 2:
# 0, 0, 2, 8, 128, 171200; 7447587840
#
# The counts of LSdiag are obtained from that via multiplication by N!.
#
# As with LSdiag, max-deg/dom-var seems the best variable-selection,
# and domain-prop best node-wise, while values-prop best time-wise.
