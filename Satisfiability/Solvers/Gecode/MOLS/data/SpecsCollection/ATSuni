# N=24 is the first challenge (SAT decision; the first somewhat harder case
# is N=22):
# MOLS> ./gcMols 24 data/SpecsCollection/ATSuni "" satd "dom" "maxdegdom" "" ""
# not solver after 7h.
# On okserver:
# MOLS> ./gcMols 24 data/SpecsCollection/ATSuni "" satd "dom" "maxdegdom" "" 16

# The sequence of satisfiable N is:
# 2, 4, 8, 16, 20
# Here it is interesting to guess the sequence!
