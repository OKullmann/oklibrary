# Counts for N >= 2:

# Like basis, but without row reduction (rred).
# It is stated in basis that "Without rred, sat-decision seems much easier for N <= 16".
# Some experiments already exist, but count is used instead of satd.
# Instead of expanding basis file further, maybe it's better to create a separate spec file for that.

# MOLS> ./gcMols "2,20" data/SpecsCollection/Pandiagonal/gpbasis "" satd dom bin mindegdom "" 1 50 "t,10"
# XXX Running on server XXX

# In basis, count is calculated for N=13 using rlaMols and aborted.
# Here, I suggest we run, satd for N's that are in range 2 <= N <= 20.
# To find out which combination works best for rlaMols.
# MOLS> ./rlaMols "2,20" data/SpecsCollection/Pandiagonal/gpbasis "" satd - - - - - 1 50 "satc,1" ""
# If you have any suggestion on stop type, please help.
# Since in rlaMols stop-type for time doesn't exist.
