# Far best seems dom+binbr+maxdom+desc
# Results in Pandiagonal for N=13 suggest it is unsatisfiable, but indeed it
# is satisfiable:
# MOLS> ./gcMols 13 data/SpecsCollection/SudokuPandiagonal "" +enum dom binbr maxdom desc 12
# aborted after 20h wall-clock and 5 solutions found.

# Unsatisfiability-decision for 14 <= N <= 16 much easier with "rred A"
# disabled (as with "Pandiagonal")! Disabling this also for N=17:
# MOLS> ./gcMols 17 data/SpecsCollection/SudokuPandiagonal "" sats dom binbr maxdom desc 12
# Aborted after 41h wall-clock (without finding a solution).

# Unsatisfiable at least on the cases where Pandiagonal is unsatisfiable,
# that is, where gcd(N,6) != 1; for N <= 16 there are no further cases
# of unsatisfiability -- does this hold in general?
# N=11 is the first case where the box-condition means a restriction
# (for counting; compare "Pandiagonal").
# For N=12 there are queens-solutions (see "SudokoQueen").

# A really interesting case is N=25.
