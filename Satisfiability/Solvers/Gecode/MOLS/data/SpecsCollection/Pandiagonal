# Counts for N >= 2:
# 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0,
# 12, 0, >= 1, 0, 0, 0
# Remark: count != 0 iff gcd(N,6) = 1.

# Apparently not on OEIS.

# Far best seems dom+binbr+maxdom.
# N=17 seems a hard satisfiable instance.
# Decision for 13 <= N <= 16 much easier without rred (also the unsatisfiable
# cases!); something special is going on here, as indicated also by "maxdom".
