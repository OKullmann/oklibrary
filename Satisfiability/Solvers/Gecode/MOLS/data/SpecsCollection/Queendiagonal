# As for Pandiagonal, decision without rred might be easier.

# The current data is identical with Pandiagonal, but for N=12 there exist
# even sudoku-queens-solutions (which are apparently easier to find -- and
# pandiagonal solutions are even much easier to find).
# SudokuQueen is different for N=11.
