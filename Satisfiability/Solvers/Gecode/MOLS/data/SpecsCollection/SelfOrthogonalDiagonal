# The square in the file sodls_N7_unsat is a solf-orthogonal diagonal Latin square of order 7,
# but gcMols decides that it is not.
# The square is:
# 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
# 2 3 6 5 0 4 1
# 4 2 5 0 1 6 3
# 6 4 1 2 3 0 5
# 1 5 3 4 6 2 0
# 3 0 4 6 5 1 2
# 5 6 0 1 2 3 4
# Its tranpose is:
# 0 2 4 6 1 3 5
# 1 3 2 4 5 0 6
# 2 6 5 1 3 4 0
# 3 5 0 2 4 6 1
# 4 0 1 3 6 5 2
# 5 4 6 0 2 1 3
# 6 1 3 5 0 2 4
# This two Latin squares are orthogonal, it was checked by hand.
