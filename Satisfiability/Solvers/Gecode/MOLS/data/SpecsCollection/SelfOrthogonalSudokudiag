# Counts for N >= 2:
# 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 10

# These are special case of EulerSudokudiag.
# Satisfiability for N=10 is interesting.

# Counts for "semi-diagonal" (not "antidiag A") are
# 0, 0, 2, 8, 0, 512, 8064.


# gcMols:

# N=7:

# MOLS> ./gcMols 7 data/SpecsCollection/SelfOrthogonalSudokudiag "" count dom - - - 1 6 "t,20"
# Best: maxdegdom, both with bin and enu (hardly a difference).

# N=8:

# MOLS> ./gcMols 8 data/SpecsCollection/SelfOrthogonalSudokudiag "" count dom bin maxdegdom "" 1 12 ""
# aborted after 5h wallclock-time:
# this seems an example where first creating the larger collection of
# semidiagonal selforthogonal Sudokus (using bin+mindegdom+desc),
# and then selecting from the solutions the fully diagonal ones, would be
# much faster.
# It might be though that bin+maxdegdom is not fastest (it was not checked).
