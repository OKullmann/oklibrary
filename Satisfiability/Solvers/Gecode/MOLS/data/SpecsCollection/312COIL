# Counts for N >= 2:
# 0, 0, 0, 18, 0, 360, >= 736, >= 11
# Also known as "QG2".
# Unsatisfiabiblity for N=10 shown by [Dubois, Dequen, 2001] (this is
# the only unsatisfiable case for N >= 7).
# This is an interesting testcase:
# MOLS> ./gcMols 9 data/SpecsCollection/312COIL "" +count dom binbr mindom desc 12
# aborted after 105 hours wall-clock.

# Question: are there better representations of orthogonality here?
