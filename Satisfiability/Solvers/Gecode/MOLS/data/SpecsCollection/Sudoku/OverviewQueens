Let MQ(N) be the maximal number of queens for an NxN Sudoku.
Let CMQ(N) be the number of Sudokus with MQ(N) queens,
while CQ(N,i) is the number of Sudokus with exactly i queens
(thus CMQ(N) = CQ(N,MQ(N))).

Furthermore let
  SCQ(N,i) be the number of Sudokus with exactly the first i cells
  in the first row being queens (there might be further queens, after
  a gap).
Remark: As the basis of efficient counting one needed (somehow) to consider
  SCQ(N, S) for S any subset of the column-indices; but likely we don't
  do such things (for now).

And let C(N) be the number of Sudokus at all (in "basis").


MQ(N) = N iff Queendiagonal/sudoku is solvable, and then
CMQ(N) is the number of Sudokus recorded there.
MQ(N) >= N-1 iff Queendiagonal/m1sudoku is solvable.

For N <= 11 we have
  MQ(N) = N iff N in {5, 7, 11}, where
  CMQ(5) = 2 * 5! = 240
  CMQ(7) = 4 * 7! = 20160
  CMQ(11) = 4 * 11! = 159667200.

-----------------------------------------------------

N=1:

  C(1) = 1
  MQ(1) = 1
  CMQ(1) = 1

---

N=2:

  C(2) = 1 * 2! = 2
  MQ(2) = 0

---

N=3:

  C(3) = 2 * 3! = 12
  MQ(3) = 0

---

N=4:

  C(4) = 12 * 4! = 288
  MQ(4) = 2
  CMQ(4) = 4

  36 Sudokus for >= 1 bishop in gp1bishop
  4 Sudokus for >= 1 bishop2 in gp2bishop

  CQ(4,0) = 288 - 36 = 252
  CQ(4,1) = 36 - 4 = 32
  CQ(4,2) = 4

By p1bishop we have
  0 * 4! = 0 Sudokus with >= 1 queen, where one queen sits
  in the first cell (top-left corner).

  SCQ(4,0) = 288 - 0 = 288
  SCQ(4,1) = 0.

---

N=5:

  C(5) = 240 * 5! = 28800
  MQ(5) = 5
  CMQ(5) = 240

  3600 Sudokus for >= 1 bishop in gp1bishop
  624 Sudokus for >= 2 bishops in gp2bishop
  240 Sudokus for >= 3 bishops in gp3bishop

  CQ(5,0) = 28800 - 3600 = 25200
  CQ(5,1) = 3600 - 624 = 2976
  CQ(5,2) = 624 - 240 = 384
  CQ(5,3) = 0
  CQ(5,4) = 0
  CQ(5,5) = 240.

By p1bishop we have
  30 * 5! = 3600 Sudokus with >= 1 queen, where one queen sits
  in the first cell.
By p2bishop we have
  6 * 5! = 720 Sudokus with >= 2 queens, where two queens sit
  in the first two cells.
All p3/4/5bishop all yield 2.
So
  SCQ(5,0) = 28800 - 3600 = 25200
  SCQ(5,1) = 3600 - 720 = 2880
  SCQ(5,2) = 720 - 240 = 480
  SCQ(5,3) = 0
  SCQ(5,4) = 0
  SCQ(5,5) = 2 * 5! = 240.

Is this coincidence: SCQ(5,0) = CQ(5,0) ?:
  SCQ(5,0) includes Sudokus with 1 or 2 queens, iff they don't occupy
  the first cell.
  SCQ(5,1) includes Sudokus with 2 queens, iff they don't occupy the
  second cell.

N=6:

  C(6) = 43648 * 6! = 31426560
  MQ(6) = 2
  CMQ(6) = 9120

  327360 Sudokus for >= 1 bishop in gp1bishop
  9120 Sudokus for >= 2 bishop in gp2bishop

  CQ(6,0) = 31426560 - 327360 = 31099200
  CQ(6,1) = 327360 - 9120  = 318240
  CQ(6,2) = 9120

  CQ(7,0) = 3606183383040 - 43918567200 = 3562264815840
  CQ(7,1) = 43918567200 - 450701280 = 43467865920
  CQ(7,2) = 450701280 - ?

  37 * 7! = 186480 Sudokus with >= 4 queens in p4bishop

  SCQ(7,0) = 3606183383040 - 29795159520 = 3576388223520
  SCQ(7,1) = 29795159520 - 312908400 = 29482251120
  SCQ(7,2) = 312908400 - 4692240 = 308216160

  SCQ(7,5) = 0
  SCQ(7,6) = 0
  SCQ(7,7) = 20160

Remark: The above information for SCQ(7,i) is better represented
via multiples of 7!.

The current methods are not strong enough to investigate N=8 (fully).
