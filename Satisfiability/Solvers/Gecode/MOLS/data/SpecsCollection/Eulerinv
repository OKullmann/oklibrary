# Counts for N >= 2:
# 0, 1, 2, 18, 0

# Should be the same as "Euler".

# The case N=7 is very hard for counting:
# MOLS> time ./gcMols 7 data/SpecsCollection/Euler "" count dom mindom "" 4
# running for over 32h wall-clock, without result.

squares A B aux
red A
rred B aux
ls A B aux
rprod A B aux # or "rprod B A aux" ?!
