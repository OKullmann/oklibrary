# Counts for N >= 2:
# 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 32, 1728, >= 1; 0, >= 1, >= 1, >= 1
# Best for counting and solving seems domain-prop + min-dom.
# Existence for N=14 is open.
# Unsatisfiability for N=10 is a good testcase.

# PROBLEM: in
# [Searching for Doubly Self-orthogonal Latin Squares, Lu, Liu, Zhang]
# in Table 4 the counts reported for N=7,8 are 64, 1152 ??
# MOLS> ./gcMols_debug 7 data/SpecsCollection/DoublySelfOrthogonalDiagonal "" count "dom" "mindom" "" 1
# domain-prop min-dom-var bin-branch-min 32 0.101 242580 487 1037 10
# (They use idempotency for symmetry-breaking, but row-reducedness seems
# better -- and the counting is the same.)
# These numbers are also in https://oeis.org/A333367 ?!?
# Have just requested a list of 64 solutions for N=7 from Eduard Vatutin.
# The list is in the file MOLS/data/Benchmarks/sodls_N7_squares.
# On the first 32 squares out of 64 from the list, gcMols reports SAT.
#
# An example of a square on which gcMols reports UNSAT is:
# 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
# 2 3 6 5 0 4 1
# 4 2 5 0 1 6 3
# 6 4 1 2 3 0 5
# 1 5 3 4 6 2 0
# 3 0 4 6 5 1 2
# 5 6 0 1 2 3 4
#
# This square is in the file MOLS/data/Benchmarks/sodls_N7_unsat
# ./gcMols_debug 7 data/SpecsCollection/DoublySelfOrthogonalDiagonal ./data/Benchmarks/sodls_N7_unsat count "dom" "mindom" "" 1
