# Counts for N >= 2:
# 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 12, 0, 0, ?
# >= 2

# For N=9 dom+mindom seems best.
# N=10 known to be unsatisfiable (see Pandiagonal), but seems a hard instance
# here (mindom seems needed for "rprod", while maxdom seems needed for
# "moddiag"?).
# For N=11 dom+maxdom+desc seems best.

# Question: it seems that the box-condition does not make much of a further
# restriction to EulerPandiag?!?
