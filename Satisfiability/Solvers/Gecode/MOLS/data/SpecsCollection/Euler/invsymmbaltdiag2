# TODO: this should better be called "invsymmbaltdiag", since
# "diag" should be default mean all primary squares.
# The "inv" refers to the wrong position of aux.
# We have "symmb" + "diag", what has preference?
# Since for "diag" it is not symmetry-breaking, using
# "symmbdiag" seems appropriate; so the question is about
# "inv" and "alt" and their order.
