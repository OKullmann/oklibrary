Results:

1) basis

All solvers solve N=5. N=6 solved by none.


2) red

All solvers solve N=6. N=7 solved only by gcMols.
On N=6, rlaMols (enu+maxdeg) has 14x better nodecount than gcMols
(dom+enum+maxdegdom), wdL and newvars are from 15% (worst case) to
60% (best case) better leaf-wise than rlaMols.


3) symmb

All solvers solve N=7. N=7 solved only by gcMols.
On N=7, rlaMols (bin+maxdegdom) has 47x better nodecount than gcMols (bin+mindom),
wdL has similar leafcount as rlaMols, while newvars is about 50 % better than rlaMols.


4) diag

All solvers solve N=7.

6) sudokudiag

All solvers solve N=7.
On N=7, rlaMols (enu+mindom) has 77x better nodecount than gcMols
(dom+bin+mindom), wdL and newvars (all but newvars-sd) have 2x better leafcount
than rlaMols. newvars-sd has similar leafcount as rlaMols.
