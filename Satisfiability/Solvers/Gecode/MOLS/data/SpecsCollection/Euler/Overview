Results:

1) basis

All solvers solve N=5. N=6 solved by none.


2) red

All solvers solve N=6. N=7 solved only by gcMols (runtime likely too high).
On N=6, rlaMols (bin+maxdeg) is 23x better leaf-wise than gcMols
(enum+maxdegdom),
laMols has similar leafcount as rlaMols.


3) symmb

All solvers solve N=7.
On N=7, rlaMols(bin+maxdegdom) is 47x better leaf-wise than gcMols(bin+mindom),
laMols(newv+avepsd) is 60 % better leaf-wise than rlaMols.


4) diag

All solvers solve N=7.
On N=7, rlaMols(bin+first) is 310x better leaf-wise than gcMols(bin+mindom).
laMols(newv+max) is 40 % better leaf-wise than rlaMols.


5) pandiag

All solvers solve N=11.
The best leaf-wise laMols(newv+ave) is 3x worse than rlaMols(enu+mindom).
Interesting brittleness of solutions.


6) sudoku

Only N=6 feasible (though gcMols finished counting).
Optimisation for wdL somewhat better than rlaMols.
Lvs-optimisation for newvars similar, while tau-optimisation
has some trouble due to extreme outliers.


7) sudokudiag

N=6 trivial.
All solvers solve N=7 (still rather easy).
On N=7, rlaMols(mindom+enu) is 72x better leaf-wise than gcMols(dom+bin+mindom).
laMols(newv+avepsd) is 2x better leaf-wise than rlaMols.
N=8 appears infeasible.


8) sudokudiagfull

N=7 is relatively simple, doesn't add something new.
N=8 with newvars much faster than rlaMols (but still much slower
than gcMols).


9) pandiagsudoku

All solvers solve N=11.
On N=11, rlaMols(enu+mindom) has only 52 leaves - seems too few for
optimising laMols.
