# Counts for N >= 2:
# 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 18, >= 587, >= 2193, ?


# By [Keedwell, 2011] for all prime powers b (the box-size; so N = b^2)
# "complete" orthogonal sets of diagonal Sudoku squares for box-size b exist,
# that is, the maximal number b^2 - b of possible MODSLS.
# So for N=9 we have 6-MODSLS, for N=16 there are 12-MODSLS, and for
# N=25 there are 20-MODSLS.

# Thus for all square N the problems here are satisfiable.

# Is N=10 unsatisfiable?

# SelfOrthogonalSudokudiag is a special case (a square is Sudoko iff
# the transposed is, and a square is diagonal iff the transposed is).
