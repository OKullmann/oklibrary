# QUESTION: aux1 and aux2 should be strongly related.
# We have
#   aux1 = (c213 A) * (at A)^-1 * aux2
#   aux2 = (at A) * (c213 A)^-1 * aux1
# Both (at A)^-1, (c213 A)^-1 can be expressed as one of the 12 versions:
#   (at A)^-1 -> c132 circ at = ?
#   (c213 A)^-1 -> c132 circ c213 = c231.
# This gives at least further (redundant) constraints (using "X" below):
#   ?
#   aux2 = (at A) * c312 A * aux1
# They might be useful for (r)la.
# Question: is there a better presentation of (at A) * c312 A ?


# QUESTION: SAT-decision for DoublySelfOrthgonalinv appears to be much faster
# (N=10 is easy) -- is this SAT-equivalent (the counts are different)?
# The SAT-results seem the same.
