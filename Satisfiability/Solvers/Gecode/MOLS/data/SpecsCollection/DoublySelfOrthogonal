# Counts for N >= 2:
# 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 32, 1728, >= 1; 0, >= 1, >= 1, >= 1
# Best for counting and solving seems domain-prop + min-dom.
# Existence for N=14 is open.
# Unsatisfiability for N=10 is a good testcase.

# PROBLEM: in
# [Searching for Doubly Self-orthogonal Latin Squares, Lu, Liu, Zhang]
# in Table 4 the counts reported for N=7,8 are 64, 1152 ??
# MOLS> ./gcMols_debug 7 data/SpecsCollection/DoublySelfOrthogonal "" count "dom" "mindom" "" 1
# domain-prop min-dom-var bin-branch-min 32 0.101 242580 487 1037 10
# (They use idempotency for symmetry-breaking, but row-reducedness seems
# better -- and the counting is the same.)
# These numbers are also in https://oeis.org/A333367 ?!?
# Have just requested a list of 64 solutions for N=7 from Eduard Vatutin.
# It seems it would be easier to find the reason having these solutions.
