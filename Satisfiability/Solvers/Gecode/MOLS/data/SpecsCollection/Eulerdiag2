# Counts for N >= 2:
# 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, >= 76, ?

# The motivation here is to have "as much propagation as possible".
# Perhaps a better name is "pairs of orthogonal X-Sudokus";
# "rred A B" should be "w.l.o.g.", and "rred aux" follows.

# Question: do "diag aux" and "antidiag aux" also follow? Would be surprising.
# The count for N=7 (6) is the same when removing them, but for N=8 we
# seem to get many more solutions.
# Same question for "box aux": here no change is visible, so perhaps it is
# implied?

# Question: every pair (if we don't have A=B, which is impossible)
# is enumerated twice -- how can this symmetry be broken here?
