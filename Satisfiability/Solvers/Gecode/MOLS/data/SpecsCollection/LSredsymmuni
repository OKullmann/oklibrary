# Remark: https://oeis.org/A003191 seems nonsense
# Remarks: the odd N could be nice benchmarks (all unsatisfiable):
#  - with gc-standard the best seems "domain-prop max-dom-var" (N=13 becomes
#    hard)
#  - quite surprising to use "max-dom" ?!
#  - very similar behaviour: min-deg/dom-var.
#  - bounds-prop should here be the same as dom-prop.
#  - default-prop should be value-prop, which performs very badly.
