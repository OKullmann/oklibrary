# Counts for 2 <= N <= 11:
# 1,0,1,0,6,0,6240,0,1225566720,0
# https://oeis.org/A000438
# Remark: https://oeis.org/A003191 seems nonsense
# Remarks: the odd N could be nice benchmarks (all unsatisfiable):
#  - with gc-standard the best seems "domain-prop max-dom-var" (N=13 becomes
#    hard)
#  - quite surprising to use "max-dom" ?!
#  - very similar behaviour: min-deg/dom-var.
#  - bounds-prop should here be the same as dom-prop.
#  - default-prop should be value-prop, which performs very badly.
# For even N on the other hand the (usual) min-dom is better:
# MOLS> ./gcMols 10 data/SpecsCollection/LSredsymmuni "" count "" "mindom,maxdom" ""
# # N=10
# # k=1 total_num_sq=1
# # num_ps=0
# # rt=count-solutions
# # num_runs=2
# # propagation: domain-prop
# # variable-heuristics: min-dom-var max-dom-var
# # order-heuristics: bin-branch-min
# domain-prop min-dom-var bin-branch-min 1225566720 11189
