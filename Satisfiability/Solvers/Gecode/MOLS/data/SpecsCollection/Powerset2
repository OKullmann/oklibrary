# Counts for N >= 2:
# 0, 6, 48, 2160, 0, >= 1

# The open conjecture is that except for N=2,6 all other N
# are satisfiable; this is known for N <= 50, and all larger N
# except for N congruent 2 mod 6.

# The relevant feature here is that P1, P2 are orthogonal.

# QUESTION: which kind of symmetry-breaking can be imposed here?

# gcMols: dom+enu+mindom seems best.
