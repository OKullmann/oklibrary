# Number of row-reduced pairs of orthogonal diagonal Latin squares of order n.

# Counts for N >= 2:
# 0, 0, 2, 4, 0 160

# This should be https://oeis.org/A287651 .
# PROBLEM: for N=7 OEIS has 320.
# After that comes 1322496 in the OEIS sequence.

# The combination dom-prop + maxdegdom seems best.
