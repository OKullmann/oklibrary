# Counts for N >= 2:
# 0, 0, 2, 12, 0, 3840

# What is known about satisfiability? Are all N >= 7 satisfiable?

# A sequence with the same initial part is
# in SelfOrthogonalidem
# QUESTION: are these conditions equivalent?

# N=7: The count is higher than for the inverse version ("SelfOrthogonalinvdiag"),
