# QUESTION: what is the relation to 3MOLSinv (regarding solutions and solving-
# time)?


# gcMols:

# MOLS> time ./gcMols 7 data/SpecsCollection/3MOLS "" +count dom enu maxdegdom desc 1 12
# aborted after 8 min wallclock-time without finding a solution.




# rlaMols:

# MOLS> time ./rlaMols 7 data/SpecsCollection/3MOLS "" +count dom enu maxdegdom "" "" 1 12
# aborted after 90s wallclock-time (8 solutions found).
# As 3MOLSsymmb, this seems to be one of the rare case where plain rlaMols is better than gcMols.
# Rerunning for longer:
# MOLS> time ./rlaMols 7 data/SpecsCollection/3MOLS/basis "" +count dom enu maxdegdom "" "" 1 16 ""
# running on server2 XXX




squares A B C AB AC BC
ls A B C AB AC BC
red A
rred B C
rprod B AB A # thus A = AB^-1 B
rprod C AC A # thus A = AC^-1 C
rprod C BC B # AB^-1 B = AC^-1 C => BC = AC AB^-1

# Redundant condition:
# rprod BC   AC         c132 AB
