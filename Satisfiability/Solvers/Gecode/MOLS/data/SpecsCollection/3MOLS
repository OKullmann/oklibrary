# Counts for N >= 2:

# Apparently not in OEIS?

# It seems the redundant condition does not increase propagation-strength.
# Using the redundant condition as replacement is done 3MOLSalt.
#
# Best seems dom-prop + max-deg-dom.
# For example:
# MOLS> time ./gcMols 7 data/SpecsCollection/3MOLS "" count "dom" "maxdegdom" "" "12"
# XXX

squares A B C AB AC BC
ls A B C AB AC BC
red A
rred B C
rprod B A AB # thus A = B AB^-1
rprod C A AC # thus C = B AB^-1 AC
rprod C B BC # thus BC = AB^-1 AC

# Redundant condition:
# rprod BC   c132 AB   AC
