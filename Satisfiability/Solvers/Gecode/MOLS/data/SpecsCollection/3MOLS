# Counts for N >= 2:
# 0, 0, 2, 36, 0, 2400
# Apparently not in OEIS?
# Best seems dom-prop + max-deg-dom.
#
# It seems the redundant condition does not increase propagation-strength.
# Using the redundant condition as replacement is done in 3MOLSalt.
#
# For example:
# MOLS> time ./gcMols 7 data/SpecsCollection/3MOLS "" count dom maxdegdom "" 12
# domain-prop max-deg/dom-var bin-branch-min 2400 219997.345 442531358285 1571957981 3143920761 45
# real	335m51.071s user	3666m37.351s sys	41m23.222s
# Performance roughly similar to 3MOLSalt (which uses for the orthogonality
# of B and C the "redundant condition" below).
# 
# MOLS> time ./gcMols 8 data/SpecsCollection/3MOLS "" sats dom maxdegdom "" 16
# output-file SOLUTIONS_gcMols_8_1649238405864616098

# Finding one 3MOLS of order 8 is harder than counting all 3MOLS of order 7,
# but runtime is still reasonable.
