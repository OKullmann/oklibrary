# QUESTION: what is the relation to 3MOLSinv (regarding solutions and solving-
# time)?

squares A B C AB AC BC
ls A B C AB AC BC
red A
rred B C
rprod B AB A # thus A = AB^-1 B
rprod C AC A # thus A = AC^-1 C
rprod C BC B # AB^-1 B = AC^-1 C => BC = AC AB^-1

# Redundant condition:
# rprod BC   AC         c132 AB
