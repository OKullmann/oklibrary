Results:

1) basis

All solvers solve N=6.

N=7 yet only solved by rlaMols (enu+maxdegdom).
Final attempt for now running considering newv (possibly better).


2) symmb

All solvers solve N=6.

gcMols unsuccessful for N=7.
newvars, rlaMols (enu+maxdegdom), wdL can solve N=7 (in this order).
newvars has 50% leafcount of rlaMols, which has 30% leafcount of wdL.


3) diag

All solvers solve N=7.
rlaMols (enu+mindom) has the usual 2 orders of magnitude lower leafcount than
gcMols (enu+mindom).
wdL similar to rlaMols, newvars somewhat better.


4) sudokudiag

All solvers solve N=7.
rlaMols (first) has 25x better nodecount than gcMols(mindom),
wdL and newvars have 30% of leafcount of rlaMols.


5) pandiag

N <= 10 solved by all solvers, N=11 seems too hard to enumerate.

N=10: rlaMols (enu+mindom) 5 orders of magnitude lower leafcount than
gcMols (bin+mindom); roughly 20x faster.
laMols with wdL and newv even lower node-count.


6) pandiagsudoku
