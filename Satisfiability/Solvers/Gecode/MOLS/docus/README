rlaMols - branching strategies as in gcMols, but with the lookahead-reduction.
laMols  - uses look-ahead for reduction and branching.

1. Counting all 9408 reduced ls's for N=6:
MOLS> ./gcMols 6 data/SpecsCollection/LSred "" count "-" "" -first "" 1 1 ""

2. Counting all 36 triples of mutually orthogonal latin squares (MOLS) for N=5:
MOLS> ./rlaMols 5 data/SpecsCollection/3MOLS "" count dom enu maxdegdom "" eagpr 1 6 ""

3. Counting all 18 pairs of MOLS for N=6:
MOLS> ./laMols 5 "@squares A B aux\nls A B aux\nred A\nrred B\nrprod B aux A\n" "" count dom enu wdL "" "" 1 3 "" ""
