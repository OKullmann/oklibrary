This is a partial documentation for the Gecode C++ library (version 6.2.0).
It covers main pecularities, which are crucial for adding lookahead to Gecode.

The partial documentation is based on the following sources:

Variable, constraint, and constraint propagation are treated in a standard way
as it is done in Constraint Programming.

First, three main Gecode classes, Propagator, Space and Brancher, are described.
Then it is explained how objects of the class Space correspond to nodes during
the search performed by a search engine. Finally, the memory management is
discussed.

I. Propagator

Propagator performs constraint propagation. 

Hereinafter, Propagator is a Gecode class, while propagator is an object of
the class Propagator.

Each propagator is subscribed to a set of variables and performs constraint
propagation for some constraint. When domain of any subscribed variable is
changed, the function propagate() of the corresponding propagator is called.
This function removes values from variables that are in conflict with the
constraint.

propagators which are needed to be executed because of changed domains
of their subscribed variables are called *scheduled propagators*.
Scheduled propagators form *queue of scheduled propagators*.


II. Space

Space contains variables, to which constraints can be added.

Hereinafter, Space is a Gecode class, while space is an object of the class
Space.

Main Space member functions are status() and clone().

a) status()
Calls propagate() for all scheduled propagators from the queue. It is possible
that new propagators are scheduled as a result of propagations, in this case
they are added to the queue. Propagations are executed until the queue is
empty.

There are three possible return values of the status() function:
1) SS_FAILED if the space is failed (i.e. current assignments conflict with
the constraints);
2) SS_SOLVED if a solution is found;
3) SS_BRANCH otherwise.
In case of SS_BRANCH the space is ready for calling a Brancher on it to form
a branching.

b) clone()
Creates a copy of a given space. The given space must be stable (i.e. status()
must be called for it beforehand). Moreover, clone() is called only if status()
returns SS_BRANCH. First, all constraints are copied, then the copy() function
is called. copy() is a virtual function that must be implemented in a class
inherited from the class Space (e.g. SendMoreMoney). The copy() function must
copy all variables.


III. Brancher

This class implements branchings for spaces.

Main member functions are:

- choice()
Forms a branching in the form of a set of branches.

- commit()
Commits a particular branch formed by choice(), e.g., by assigning values
of some variables.

After the set of branches if formed in choice(), for each branch the clone
of the current space is created. The commit() function performs actions
on the cloned space. The commit() function is followed by status()
to reach a fixpoint for the space.


IV. Backtracking tree

During the search, a backtracking tree can be handled, where nodes correspond
to spaces.

When a propagation for a current space is called, there are three possible
states of propagation fixpoint, which directly correspond to return values
of the Space status() function (see above):
1) failure (the space becomes an unsat leaf);
2) solution (a sat leaf, a solution of the problem is found);
3) otherwise (an inner node, further branching is needed).


V. Search engine

First, an initial space is given to engine to initialise it. The engine calls
propagation via status(), and as a result the root node of the backtracking
tree is created. If status() does not detect a leaf (see Section III), the
current space become an inner node, and the engine calls the Brancher to
perform branching. For each branch a new space (node) is created by cloning,
commit() and status() are called on it and so on.

So for an inner node, the following function calls are performed to
create its child nodes:
status() -> choice() -> clone() -> commit() -> status().
Here the first two calls are performed only once, while the remaning three
ones are performed for every child node.

The default search engine is depth-first search, but branch-and-bound
is also available.

VI. Memory management

Gecode::Brancher does not have a virtual destructor.

All objects of Gecode type, which belong to the current home space, e.g.
IntViewArray x (which is used to store current variables' domains), are
deleted automatically when the home space is deleted. It means that such
member variables in a class derived from Gecode::Brancher are deleted
automatically.

According to Section 20.4 on improving branching, it is possible to use the
Gecode::dispose() function to provide a destructor for any other member
variables (which do not belong to the current home space) in a class derived
from Gecode::Brancher.


---------------------------------

Installation of version 6.3.0:

Download from

  https://github.com/Gecode/gecode/tree/release/6.3.0

> md5sum gecode-release-6.3.0.zip
19283ceb9c34978b7f614e5ea55f6bea  gecode-release-6.3.0.zip

gecode-release-6.3.0> ./configure
gecode-release-6.3.0> make
gecode-release-6.3.0> sudo make install

Again, after a fix:

  https://github.com/Gecode/gecode/tree/cpp-conformance-fixes

> md5sum gecode-cpp-conformance-fixes.zip
385258caa902518367eecbb1d12973ff  gecode-cpp-conformance-fixes.zip

gecode-cpp-conformance-fixes> ./configure
gecode-cpp-conformance-fixes> make -j6
gecode-cpp-conformance-fixes> sudo make install

Now problems with loading dynamic libraries at runtime, e.g.:

MOLS> ./Euler
./Euler: error while loading shared libraries: libgecodesearch.so.51: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

In /usr/local/lib we have

lrwxrwxrwx 1 kullmann kullmann        23 Jan 18 07:11 libgecodesearch.so.51 -> libgecodesearch.so.51.0
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root     root       3328320 Jan 18 07:12 libgecodesearch.so.51.0

Needed to execute:

MOLS> sudo /sbin/ldconfig -v

Now everything seems to work.
