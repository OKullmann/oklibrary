/* TODOS

1. Statistics on nodes
    - Additionally to the statistics offered by Gecode, we must have our own
      counting.
    - An assignment like nodes = stat.node makes no sense: nodes is what is
      counted, stat.node is what Gecode delivers -- we don't know the
      precise relation (and we need full control).
    - Also leaves = failed_nodes + solutions and inner_nodes = nodes - leaves
      makes no sense here: a main point of the statistics, as discussed,
      is to check the framework. So leaves, inner nodes etc. must be properly
      observed and counted.
    - Once a proper understanding has been established, asserts state the
      relations between the direct counts and the Gecode-numbers.
    - Precise definitions of all special node-types are needed (in relation
      to the tree, to be defined).
    - Perhaps there is a call-back for failed leaves with nogood-learning.
    - Improve placement of solutions-count.
    - In binary branching, stat.node - stat.fail - solutions (i.e. the
      number of inner nodes in the search tree) is equal to the number of
      copy() calls in the search engine, but for n-ary branching this is
      not the case.
    - The correctness of the search tree formed by the n-ary branching
      was checked by hand.

4. Add statistics on branching widths.
    - Use Statistics::BasicStats.

5. Develop an explicit representation of branching (as vectors of
   "partial assignments" (power-literals).
    - Can the current domain be explicitly represented?

6. Where is the call-back for actions when "starting" a node?
    - After all propagations have been done, before branching.
