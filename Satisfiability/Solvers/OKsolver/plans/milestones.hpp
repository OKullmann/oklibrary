  \par Version history

   - 0.5   : 18.8.2007; initial version number (the old OKsolver is compilable and apparently bug-free, and there is a sort of complete outline of the anticipated new solver 2.0).
   - 0.5.1 : 16.9.2007; one further bug eliminated, basic tests for old OKsolver established, and now all the main variants appear to be bug-free.
