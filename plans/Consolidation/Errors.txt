  \brief Plans for consolidated errors


  \todo
  <ul>
   <li> There are several classes for error codes, e.g.
   Satisfiability/Transformers/Generators/LatinSquares/Errors.hpp
   Satisfiability/Transformers/Generators/Random/ClauseSets.hpp </li>
   <li> In LSRG.cpp the class from ClauseSets.hpp is used, but since LSRG generates
   Latin squares, the class Errors.hpp could also be used </li>
   <li> It might be better to have a dedicated header with error classes. </li>
  </ul>
