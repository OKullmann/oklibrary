  \brief Plans for consolidated statistics


  \todo
  <ul>
   <li> Different names for the same statistics fields are used, e.g. in
   Satisfiability/Transformers/Generators/Queens/GenericSAT/ExtractQueens.awk
   "t" is used, while in
   Satisfiability/Transformers/Generators/Queens/SimpleBacktracking/
   there are "ut" "wt" "st". It seems that "t" is either "ut" or "wt". </li>
   <li> Names of statistics fields are not always intuitive. </li>
   <li> A possible solution is to maintain a single file where all required output
   fields are listed (name and description for each of them). In this case if
   statistics is needed in a new program/script, then output fields should be taken
   from the file. If a required field is absent, it is added to the file. </li>
  </ul>
