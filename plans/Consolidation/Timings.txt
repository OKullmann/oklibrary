  \brief Plans for consolidated timings


  \todo Measuring elapsed user time in the source code
  <ul>
   <li> It is required to measure elapsed user time inside
   OKlib-MOLS/Satisfiability/Solvers/Gecode/MOLS/Euler.cpp </li>
   <li> The state-of-the art for measuring elapsed time is
   Programming/InputOutput/Timing.hpp
   but this is only for system calls. </li>
   <li> The class UserTime for measuring elapsed time is implemented in
   Satisfiability/Solvers/TawSolver/tawSolver.cpp </li>
   <li> This class can be moved to Timing.hpp and updated in accordance with the last
   C++ standard. In this case this class could be used in Euler.cpp.</li>
  </ul>
