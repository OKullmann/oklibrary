  Documentation completed (regarding the basics)

  \section VersionTransitional100 1.0.0 Foundations completed
  A solid foundation is provided, now we can start.

   - the buildsystem-architecture cleaned-up, improved documentation-building
   - new test-system further cleaned-up (especially regarding log-messages)
   - module Messages further expanded and improved
   - started with concepts and prototypes for literals and atomic conditions
   - planning activities on many parts of the library.

   \par 0.1.2 14/1/2007

   - the buildsystem-architecture further improved, improved building of external libraries
     and documentation
   - module Messages further expanded, new utilities
   - further clean-up of the new test system
   - concepts for literals and atomic conditions expanded.

   \par 0.1.3 8/2/2007

   - moving the buildsystem towards a specified and testable system
   - initial clean-up of module Messages
   - strengthened the new test system by systematically using message-classes.

   \par 0.1.4 2/4/2007

   - concepts cleaned-up, preparing a concentrated effort
   - buildsystem further moved towards a specified and testable system, and
     various doxygen-related improvements.

   \par 0.1.5 25/6/2007

   - most work in the buildsystem: new version control system Git, planning
     for the first release, various upgrades and improvements
   - completed the basic installation (and upgrading) of UBCSAT (in module LocalSearch),
     and established usage (in module Autarkies/Search)
   - various SAT-plans expanded (on hypergraph transversals, cryptanalysis, Sudoku, problem generators,
     reductions, resolution)
   - some advancements in programming (usage of threads, numerics, messages).

   \par 0.2.0 24/9/2007

   - complete overhaul of the buildsystem: installing the new configuration
     management system, improvement of build capabilities (including new
     masterscript oklib), established the local pages and the Internet
     pages with associated package building, extended documentation;
     also various external sources installed, and basic documentation
     provided
   - started complete restructuring of the directory structure (and of the
     associated namespaces)
   - starting overhauling the old OKsolver, removed bugs and making
     it compiling again; also other transfers regarding old code,
     and extended plans
   - various works on computer algebra and cryptology; started using
     Maxima (and Sage), and further plans
   - decided upon the licence and added appropriate texts to all major files
   - further investigations into distributed development (Git, mailing lists,
     etc.).
