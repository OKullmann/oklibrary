  \brief General plans regarding monitoring solvers


  \todo Create milestones


  \bug False treatment of "decisions"
  <ul>
   <li> Column "decisions" is treated as factor! This is obviously false.
   </li>
   <li> The cause of the problem is that the dataframe was never specified,
   but just some "data put into it". </li>
  </ul>


  \bug Inappropriate column names
  <ul>
   <li> Column names must be short, never like
   "decisions_per_sec". </li>
   <li> We also use standardised notations where possible:
    <ol>
     <li> "n" for the number of variables </li>
     <li> "c" for the number of clauses </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Once the new names are in places (for all such functions), then also
   specification must be provided (not just some example). </li>
   <li> And there is also a type mismatch: we get warnings
   "1: inaccurate integer conversion in coercion". </li>
  </ul>
