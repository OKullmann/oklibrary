  \par Version history

   - 0.4   : 23.8.2007; initial version number (basic, basically running system for competition evaluation, and creating, running and storing experiments with random formulas).
   - 0.4.1 : 1.11.2011; many investigations, some tools for local search and complete SAT solvers, started with the renewal of the OKgenerator.
