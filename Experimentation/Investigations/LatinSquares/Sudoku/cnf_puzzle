# NAME
#      cnf_puzzle
# SYNOPSIS
#      cnf_puzzle empty
# DESCRIPTION
#      cnf_puzzle outputs a Sudoku puzzle in Dimacs-cnf-format according to 
#      the direct encoding. The file "empty" is a cnf-file in Dimacs format 
#      representing an empty Sudoku puzzle. The puzzle-string, read from
#      standard input, contains 81 digits with values between 0 and 9. 
#      0 represents an empty cell. The fixed fields of the puzzle are 
#      specified by non-zero values. If position 1 <= i <= 81 contains 
#      non-zero value k then the final Sudoku puzzle output has fixed field 
#      ((i-1)/9+1, (i-1)%9+1) with value k, where / is integer division and 
#      % is the modulus operator.
# EXAMPLE
#      If "sudoku17" is a file containing lines of 81 digits, with each line
#      representing a different Sudoku puzzle according to the input format 
#      given above, then:
#       head -n 1 sudoku17 | ./cnf_puzzle WeakPb_Sudoku_Box_dim_3.cnf > p.cnf
#      creates a Dimacs-cnf-format file "p.cnf" representing the first 
#      puzzle from "sudoku17".
