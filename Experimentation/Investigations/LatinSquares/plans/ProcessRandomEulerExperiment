# ProcessRandomEulerExperiment N solver

# creates a directory
# Random_Euler_${N}_${solver}_${timestamp}
# which contains a Makefile ready to perform the (continuous) experimentation.

# Variables for customisation, and their default-values:

#  - order = 5
#  - solver = Euler
#  - timestamp = UNIX-time in nanoseconds

# Version 0.0.2
