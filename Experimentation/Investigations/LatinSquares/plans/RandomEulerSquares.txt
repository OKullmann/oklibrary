Creating random Euler-square completion problems

1. Planning the experimentation for measuring the SAT-probabilities

Parameters: - N (dimension)
            - q (the proportion of randomly filled cells in the first square

The creation is such that the first square is always satisfiable (can be
completed to a ls).

Example for a single run (N = 7, q = m/N^2):

> LSRG 7,2 "-co" "1*0,0,m;1*0,0,0" t | solving-program

Here the "50%" value appears to be m ~ 15.
