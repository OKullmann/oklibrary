  \brief Investigations regarding extended resolution for pigeonhole clause-sets


 \todo Extended PHP clause-sets
  <ul>
   <li> Computed by output_weak_php_unsat_ext_stdname(n). </li>
   <li> Performance of SAT solvers (n is the number of holes):
    <ol>
     <li> First impression with cryptominisat (csltok with 2.0 GHz):
     \verbatim
n=10
18.65s
n=11
38.64s
n=12
249.72s
n=13
886.28s
n=14
13187.05s
# with n=14 worse than PHP itself
     \endverbatim
     </li>
     <li> The other solvers seem to perform worse (and also not better than
     their PHP-performance). Though one needs to see complete data. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> So apparently no solver can make use of the extension. This seems
   understandable, given the complicated nature of the resolution proof for
   the extension --- all clauses have to be used, in a special order. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Hardness
  <ul>
   <li> The hardness of weak_php(m,m-1) vs weak_php_unsat_ext_fcs(m):
   \verbatim
maxima> for m : 1 while true do
  print([hardness_wpi_cs(weak_php_fcs(m,m-1)[2],{{}}),
         hardness_wpi_cs(weak_php_unsat_ext_fcs(m)[2],{{}})])$
[0,0]
[1,1]
[2,2]
[3,3]
[4,4]
     \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> weak_php_unsat_ext_fcs(m) has a polynomial size resolution proof.
   However, what is the complexity of the smallest tree resolution proof?
   </li>
  </ul>
