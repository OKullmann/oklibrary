  \brief Investigations regarding pigeonhole clause-sets


  \todo Statistics on the performance of SAT solvers
  <ul>
   <li> SAT instances created at Maxima level by
   output_weak_php_stdname(m,k) (m pigeons into k holes). </li>
   <li> We should at least consider PHP^{2m}_m, PHP^{m+1}_m amd PHP^m_m. </li>
   <li> Statistics for all our solvers, for m = 0, ... until it takes several
   hours, with curve fittings.

     <li> Cryptominisat 2.9.0:
      <ol>
       <li> PHP^16_15: solved in 75905.41s, with 43,150,728 conflicts (so here
       the "point of competence" seems to have been exceeded). </li>

     <li> Grasp:

       <li> PHP^12_11: self-abortion after 4.282s and 1595 conflicts. It says
       "Terminating NSAT" ? Likely "RESOURCES EXCEEDED" in the output is
       to be taken seriously. We need to ask Joao Marques-Silva. </li>
      </ol>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Also SplittingViaOKsolver+minisat is to be considered.
    <ol>
     <li> For PHP^16_15 apparenty D >= 100 for the splitting should be
     considered. </li>
     <li> However also for D=100 it doesn't seem successful; so perhaps
     higher D needs to be used. </li>
     <li> Perhaps these are examples where this approach is not efficient.
     Perhaps since even for D=100 no r_2-reductions were found? </li>
     <li> For D=120 360360 sub-instances were created (again 0 2-reductions).
     And regarding the full assignments, all assignments achieved *exactly*
     130 variables. While the number of decision-variables in them range
     from 5 to 60 (without gaps). This seems all to be very systematic. </li>
     <li> Still minisat-2.2.0 takes a long time just on the first instance.
     This perhaps is much worse than minisat-2.2.0 alone on the instance. </li>
     <li> Perhaps here the application of the partial assignments doesn't make
     the instances much easier. </li>
     <li> On the other hand, the problem seems very hard for minisat-2.2.0,
     as seen above. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> We also consider the performance of E_1(m) and E_2(m), where E_1 is
   the original Cook-extension of PHP^{m+1}_m, and E_2 is the extension of E_1
   obtained by using the resolution-refutation. </li>
   <li> See
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Backtracking/plans/OKsolver2002.hpp
   for some investigations into the trees computed by the OKsolver-2002. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Basic statistics
  <ul>
   <li> Implemented formulas:
   \verbatim
for n : 0 thru 10 do block([m:n+1], print(n,nvar_php(m,n),ncl_list_weak_php(m,n),ncl_weak_php(m,n),deficiency_weak_php(m,n)));

3 12 [[2,18],[3,4]] 22 10
4 20 [[2,40],[4,5]] 45 25
5 30 [[2,75],[5,6]] 81 51
6 42 [[2,126],[6,7]] 133 91
7 56 [[2,196],[7,8]] 204 148
8 72 [[2,288],[8,9]] 297 225
9 90 [[2,405],[9,10]] 415 325
10 110 [[2,550],[10,11]] 561 451
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> The numbers of satisfying assignments for satisfiable instances:
   \verbatim
for m : 0 thru 4 do print(m,satprob_weak_php(m,m)*2^(m*m));
0 1
1 1
2 2
3 6
4 24
   \endverbatim
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Conflict-independence number
  <ul>
   <li> Computed via
   \verbatim
for n : 0 thru 6 do print(n,independence_number_m_cs(weak_php_cs(n+1,n)));
0 1
1 2
2 6
3 18
4 40
5 75
6 126
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> We should be able to figure this out; see below. </li>
  </ul>



  \todo Conflict-partition_number
  <ul>
   <li> The conflict-partition_number as upper-bounded by the length of
   hitting_decomposition_m_cs(weak_php(n+1,n)[2]) seems to be the
   same as the conflict-independence number:
   \verbatim
for n : 0 thru 6 do print(n,partition_number_m_cs(weak_php_cs(n+1,n)));
0 1
1 2
2 6
3 18
4 40
5 75
6 126
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> Perhaps the conflict-graph is even perfect?! </li>
   <li> In general: Is the hermitian deficiency actually an upper bound
   on the conflict-partition-number ?!? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Hermitian rank
  <ul>
   <li> Data on hermitian rank and deficiency:
   \verbatim
for n : 0 thru 6 do block([F:weak_php_cs(n+1,n),h],h:hermitian_rank_cs(F),print(n,h,ncl_cs(F)-h));
0 0 1
1 1 2
2 3 6
3 4 18
4 5 40
5 6 75
6 7 126
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> We should be able to figure this out:
    <ol>
     <li> hermitian_rank(weak_php(m+1,m)) = m+1 </li>
     <li> hermitian_deficiency and conflict_independence_number follow
     suit. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Analogously to "eigensharp", we can create a notion for clause-sets
   where the conflict-independence-number equals the hermitian defect, and
   show that weak_php is an instance (while not being eigensharp). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Characteristic polynomial
  <ul>
   <li> Data:
   \verbatim
for n : 0 thru 6 do print(n, ":",charpoly_cs(weak_php_cs(n+1,n)));
0 : -x
1 : -x^3 + 2*x
2 : -x^9 + 12*x^7 - 36*x^5 + 32*x^3
3 : x^22 - 36*x^20 + 432*x^18 - 2160*x^16 + 3888*x^14
4 : -x^45 + 80*x^43 - 2400*x^41 + 34560*x^39 - 241920*x^37 + 663552*x^35
5 : -x^81 + 150*x^79 - 9000*x^77 + 280000*x^75 - 4800000*x^73 + 43200000*x^71 - 160000000*x^69
6 : -x^133 + 252*x^131 - 26460*x^129 + 1512000*x^127 - 51030000*x^125 + 1020600000*x^123 - 11226600000*x^121 + 52488000000*x^119
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> For n >= 2 there seem to be n+2 monomials, with the powers forming
   an arithmetic progression with distance 2, and coefficients alternating
   in sign. </li>
   <li> These clause-sets seem to have non-zero eigenvalues of the form
   +- a, +- b, so that we altogether get 4 different values here? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Prime implicates
  <ul>
   <li> The number and the structure of prime implicates for satisfiable php
   is needed. </li>
   <li> Simple computation via resolution closure:
   \verbatim
for n : 0 thru 4 do print(n, length(min_resolution_closure_cs(weak_php_cs(n,n))[1]));
0 0
1 1
2 12
3 87
XXX
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> Alternative method: Expanding to canonical CNF and use Quine/McCluskey:
   \verbatim
# First the size of the canonical CNFs (and the total number of full clauses):
for m : 0 thru 4 do print(m,ncl_fcs(expand_fcs(weak_php_fcs(m,m))),2^(m*m));
0 0 1
1 1 2

   </li>
   <li> We remark that PHP^m_m has exactly one DNF representation (without
   new variables), since the total satisfying assignments correspond 1-1 to
   the m! permutations of the m pigeons, and we have only these total
   satisfying assignments (a boolean function f has exactly one DNF
   representation without new variables iff f has only total satisfying
   assignments). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Applying partial assignments
  <ul>
   <li> Minimally unsatisfiable sub-clause-sets of phi * weak_php(m,n) for
   m > n:

  \todo Hardness of (extended-)pigeon-hole formulas
  <ul>
   <li> Discussion and generators for Cook's extended pigeon-hole formulas
   are available in
   "Extended Resolution clauses for the Pigeon Hole Principle" in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Generators/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> We know that:
    <ul>
     <li> weak_php(n+1,n) has hardness n from [Kullmann 1999]. </li>
     <li> Cook's extension, weak_php_unsat_ext_fcs(n), has at most
     hardness n (as weak_php(n+1,n) is a subset). </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> We conjecture that Cook's extension has exactly hardness n. </li>
   <li> The hardness of weak_php(m+1,m) vs weak_php_unsat_ext_fcs(m):
   \verbatim
maxima> for m : 0 while true do
  print([hardness_wpi_cs(weak_php_fcs(m+1,m)[2],{{}}),
         hardness_wpi_cs(weak_php_unsat_ext_fcs(m)[2],{{}})])$
[0,0]
[1,1]
[2,2]
[3,3]
[4,4]
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> weak_php_unsat_ext_fcs(m) has a polynomial size resolution proof.
   However, what is the complexity of the smallest tree resolution proof?
   </li>
  </ul>

# This is the optimal tree-resolution complexity, since all variables behave
# equally.
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> The cases (n+2,n):

0 1

# This is the optimal tree-resolution complexity, since all variables behave
# equally.
# Computation took about 40 days (using Ecl)
   \endverbatim
   Perhaps (n+2,n) is always the same as (n+1,n) ?
   </li>
   <li> Known bounds for the tree-resolution complexity trc(n) for
   PHP^{n+1}_n (counting the number of nodes in the tree):
    <ol>
     <li> From [Kullmann 1999] one gets hardness = n, and thus
     2^(n+1)-1 <= trc(n) <= 2*(n^2+n+1)^n-1. </li>
     <li> For PHP^m_n (m > n) we get
     2^(n+1)-1 <= trc(n,m) <= 2*(m*n+1)^n-1. </li>
     <li> [Iwama, Miyazaki, 1999] show the stronger bounds
     (n/4)^(n/4) <= trc(n) <= O(n^2 * n!). </li>
     <li> [Dantrchev, Riis, 2001] show more generally
     n^(Omega(n)) <= trc(n,m) <= m^(O(n)), where the upper bounds holds for
     *every* regular tree-resolution refutation. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> A formula for comp_R^*(PHP^{n+1}_n):
    <ol>
     <li> Yet we have the sequence 1,5,21,85 (for 0<=n<=3). </li>
     <li> There are four sequences in OEIS, extending it with 341,341,342,421.
     </li>
     <li> The sequence A002450 is (4^n - 1)/3, which would violate the lower
     bound (n/4)^(n/4). </li>
     <li> We should be able to compute comp_R^*(PHP^{4+1}_4) by a C++ version
     of optimal_splitting_tree_rec. </li>
     <li> But perhaps by improving the Maxima-version and using sharper bounds
     we can still do it at Maxima level. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Resolution complexity
  <ul>
   <li> Now we consider the minimum complexity rc(n) for PHP^{n+1}_n (counting
   the number of different clauses). </li>
   <li> It is known rc(n) >= 2^(Omega(n)). </li>
   <li> In [Iwama, Miyazaki, 1999] it is shown rc(n) <= O(n^2 * 2^n). </li>
   <li> In [Cook, 1976] one finds the claim
   rc(n) <= 1/2 n^3 + 1/2 n^2 + n + 1 + (n^2 + 3 n) * 2^(n-2).
   (In the paper one has (n^2 + 3 n) * 2^(n-2), which stands for the number of
   steps, and thus the number of clauses of PHP has to be added.) </li>
   <li> Alaisdair Urquhart conjectures this to be exact. </li>
   <li> Numerically:
   \verbatim
f(n) := 1/2*n^3 + 1/2*n^2 + n + 1 + (n^2 + 3*n) * 2^(n-2);
for n : 0 thru 20 do print(n,f(n),(n^2 + 3*n) * 2^(n-2));
