  \brief On investigations regarding boolean functions


  \todo Plans for investigating random boolean functions
  <ul>
   <li> We need to investigate random boolean functions to
   compare with the AES investigations (see 
   Investigations/Cryptography/AdvancedEncryptionStandard/plans/SAT2011/Experimentation.hpp). 
   </li>
   <li> Likely, we should create a new plans file for arbitrary boolean functions
   which may not fit into other categories? </li>
   <li> See "First considerations of random permutation" in 
   Experimentation/Investigations/BooleanFunctions/plans/general.hpp for an
   example of similar investigations into permutations. </li>
  </ul>

 
  \todo Add milestones
