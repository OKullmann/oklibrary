  \brief Investigating boolean functions representing permutations of {0,1}^n


  \todo Generalities
  <ul>
   <li> For a natural number n >= 0 one considers the set V_n = {0,1}^n of all
   bit-vectors. </li>
   <li> The functions to be studied here are permutations f of V_n. </li>
   <li> Permutations are represented as relations by boolean functions
   f^*: {0,1}^(2n), that is, f^*(x,y) = 1 iff f(x) = y. </li>
   <li> These boolean function have exactly one DNF-representation (using 2^n
   clauses of length 2*n). </li>
   <li> The CNF-representations are of special interest here. </li>
   <li> In ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/FiniteFunctions/Permutations.mac
   we have perm2cnffcs(P), which for a permutation P in list-form creates
   the full cnf-fcs. </li>
   <li> In
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Resolution/PrimeImplicatesImplicants.mac
   we have all_minequiv_bvs_fcs to compute than all minimum CNF's (that is,
   by all_minequiv_bvs_fcs(perm2cnffcs(P)). </li>
   <li> A simpler function there is rsubsumption_hg_full_fcs: By
   rsubsumption_hg_full_fcs(FF)[2] we obtain the list of necessary prime
   implicates (that is, by rsubsumption_hg_full_fcs(perm2cnffcs(P))[2]). </li>
   <li> The permutations are (according to our standard representation)
   not permutations of bit-vectors, but of the numbers 1,..,2^n; which
   are considered as bit-vectors using binary representation of numbers. </li>
   <li> So all permutations are created by permutations(setn(2^n)). </li>
   <li> There are 2^(2^(2n)) boolean functions altogether of 2n arguments,
   while there are (2^n)! such permutations f. </li>
   <li> V_n can be considered as an n-dimensional algebra over F_2 (the
   two-element field), consisting of the n-dimensional vectorspace over F_2
   plus the field-structure of V_n as a field of order 2^n. </li>
   <li> Special permutations of interest are as follows (based on the
   algebraic structures).
    <ol>
     <li> Linear automorphisms, of which there are order_gl(n,2). </li>
     <li> Special linear automorphisms are given by multiplication with
     non-zero field elements, of which there are 2^n-1. </li>
     <li> Translations, of which there are 2^n. </li>
     <li> Affine automorphisms, of which there are order_gl(n,2) * 2^n. </li>
     <li> The multiplicative inverse x -> x^-1, extended by 0 -> 0. </li>
     <li> The compositions of inversions with affine automorphisms. </li>
     <li> For such compositions, is there a fundamental difference between
     first applying the inversion or first applying the affine automorphism?
     </li>
    </ol>
    We need general tools (including representations and conversions) to handle
    these objects.
   </li>
   <li> Of course, besides these "algebraic permutations" we need to study
   random permutations. </li>
   <li> Isomorphism of boolean functions:
    <ol>
     <li> Most powerful is to admit permutations of variables and individual
     flips of variables. </li>
     <li> A basic question is how this compares with conjugatedness of
     permutations (equivalent to having the same cycle type)? </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo What to investigate for these boolean functions
  <ul>
   <li> The number of prime implicates is of importance, the number of
   necessary clauses amongst them, the size of minimum CNF representations,
   and their number. </li>
   <li> At Maxima-level this is computed as available by
   investigate_permutations(n) (in
   Experimentation/Investigations/BooleanFunctions/Permutations.mac). </li>
   <li> Shortest r_k-compressions of the set of prime implicates are of
   high interest (since we expect them to be most useful for their use
   in SAT-translations). See rand_rbase_cs(F,r) in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Reductions/RBases.mac. </li>
   <li> Also OBDD-representations are to be studied. </li>
   <li> And shortest circuit-representations. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Isomorphism types
  <ul>
   <li> See "Considering special boolean functions" in
   Satisfiability/Lisp/FiniteFunctions/plans/IsomorphismTypes.hpp. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Trivial cases
  <ul>
   <li> The case n=0: investigate_permutations(0) yields "1 1 1 1". </li>
   <li> The case n=1: investigate_permutations(1) yields two times
   "2 2 2 1". </li>
  </ul>


  \todo The case n=2
  <ul>
   <li> Here we have just (2^2)! = 24 permutations altogether, so we can
   conveniently list them all (by permutations({1,2,3,4})). </li>
   <li> We get
   \verbatim
h2 : investigate_permutations(2)$
ev_ip(h2);

  [4,4,4,1] 8
  [10,0,5,2] 16
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> So we have two cases: One with 4 prime implicates, which all are
   necessary, and one with 10 prime implicates, none of which are
   necessary, and having 2 minimum representations, each with 5 clauses. </li>
   <li> The first case is given by the identity, the second case by
   the permutation [1,2,4,3]:
   \verbatim
last(ev_hm(h2,[4,4,4,1]));
  [1,2,3,4]
last(ev_hm(h2,[10,0,5,2]));
[1,2,4,3]

all_minequiv_bvs_fcs(perm2cnffcs([1,2,3,4]));
  [{{-4,2},{-3,1},{-2,4},{-1,3}}]
all_minequiv_bvs_fcs(perm2cnffcs([1,2,4,3]));
  [{{-4,-3,2},{-4,-2,1},{-3,-2,4},{-1,3},{1,2,4}},
   {{-4,-2,3},{-4,-1,2},{-3,1},{-2,-1,4},{2,3,4}}]
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> The identity is treated in general below. For the second case
   (a transposition) actually the two minimum clause-sets are disjoined
   (a partitioning of the set of all prime-clauses). </li>
   <li> The number of linear automorphisms is order_gl(2,2) = 6, while there
   are 2^2=4 translationen, which makes 24 affine automorphisms altogether.
   </li>
   <li> So here every permutation is an affine automorphism. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo The case n=3
  <ul>
   <li> Here we have just (2^3)! = 40320 permutations altogether, so we
   can still consider them all (algorithmically). </li>
   <li> Experiment:
   \verbatim

   Computation aborted (last output for permutation 1897, and then until
   permutation 3277 no new cases; unclear whether there might be more
   cases --- faster computation, at C++ level is needed). </li>
   <li> Some permutations take more than a minute to process, while some take
   only a few seconds? It can't be the small hash-map? It seems it is just
   that some permutations are more difficult than others. </li>
   <li> See "Write analyse_all_permutations" in
   Investigations/BooleanFunctions/plans/general.hpp for a tool at C++ level.
   </li>
   <li> Some special cases of permutations p:
    <ol>
     <li> Some transpositions (2-cycles):
     \verbatim
P : [2,1,3,4,5,6,7,8];
evalpermasbf(P);
  [20,4,10,256]
P : [1,3,2,4,5,6,7,8];
evalpermasbf(P);
  [26,2,10,288]
P : [8,2,3,4,5,6,7,1];
evalpermasbf(P);
  [36,0,14,870]
     \endverbatim
     </li>
     <li> There are 8*7/2=28 transpositions (in general 2^n*(2^n-1)/2):
     \verbatim
t3 : investigate_transpositions(3);
ev_ip(t3);
 [20,4,10,256] 12
 [26,2,10,288] 12
 [36,0,14,870] 4
     \endverbatim
     </li>
     <li> The isomorphism-type of the boolean function should be just
     determined by the number of bits flipped in the transposition? </li>
     <li> Then in general there would be exactly n isomorphism types,
     corresponding to 1 <= f <= n flipped bits. </li>
     <li> And for f flipped bits there would be 2^n*binom(n,i)/2 permutations
     belonging to it. </li>
     <li> So in this case, for n=3: i=1 -> 8*3/2=12, i=2 -> 8*3/2=12, i=3 ->
     8*1/2=4. </li>
     <li> It remains the task to find for these 3 cases (in general n cases)
     all prime implicates, and to determine their structure (irredundant
     clauses, minimum representations). </li>
     <li> Special transitive permutations:
     \verbatim
P : cyclepres2perl({[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]});
  [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1]
evalpermasbf(P);

P : cyclepres2perl({[1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6]});
  [4,5,6,7,8,1,2,3]

  [28,0,10,48]

     \verbatim
     </li>
     <li> There are 7! = 5040 transitive permutations; perhaps this class is
     too large? Or can we say something, e.g., what are the most complicated
     boolean functions amongst them? </li>
     <li> The maximal order of a permutation here is 3*5=15:
     \verbatim
P : cyclepres2perl({[1,2,3],[4,5,6,7,8]});
  [2,3,1,5,6,7,8,4]

     \endverbatim
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The number of linear automorphisms is order_gl(3,2) = 168, while
   there are 2^3=8 translations, which makes 1344 affine automorphisms
   altogether. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo The case n=8
  <ul>
   <li> This case is especially interesting because of AES; see
   Cryptography/AdvancedEncryptionStandard/plans/FieldMulInvestigations.hpp
   and
   Cryptography/AdvancedEncryptionStandard/plans/SboxInvestigations.hpp.
   </li>
   <li> Here we have (2^8)! ~ 8.578*10^506 permutations altogether (while
   there are ~ 2.003*10^19728 boolean functions (in 16 variables). </li>
   <li> The number of linear automorphisms is order_gl(8,2) ~ 5.348*10^18.
   </li>
   <li> Special linear (affine) automorphisms to consider are the ones
   involved in the S-box and its inverse. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Prime implicates of simple permutations
  <ul>
   <li> The identity function: 
   <ul>
    <li> For the identity function id over {0,1}^n the prime implicates of
    id^* are exactly the clauses {v_{1,i},-v_{2,i}} and
    {-v_{1,i},v_{2,i}} for all 1 <= i <= n. </li>
    <li> These clauses encode the equality of the variables in the input set
    with those of the output set using binary constraints. </li>
    <li> We have here the case of a parallel and independent composition of
    n boolean functions, namely v_{1,i} = v_{2,i}. </li>
    <li> In general, for such independent parallel compositions the prime
    clauses are just taken alltogether. </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li> The negation:
    <ol>
     <li> x -> neg x componentwise. </li>
     <li> Here we have parallel independent composition of
     v_{i,1} = not v_{i,2}, and so the prime implicates are exactly the
     clauses {v_{1,i},v_{2,i}} and {-v_{1,i},-v_{2,i}} for all 1 <= i <= n.
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Sampling random permutations
  <ul>
   <li> The data should be at least the total number of clauses, the number
   of clauses of each size, and the number of irredundant clauses (easy to
   compute in this case, since the truth table is given). </li>
   <li> See "Preparations for computing optimum representations" in
   OKlib/Satisfiability/FiniteFunctions/plans/QuineMcCluskeySubsumptionHypergraph.hpp 
   for discussion of adding output of necessary clauses to the subsumption
   hypergraph generator. </li>
   <li> DONE (see analyse_random_permutations)
   A script is to be written, which generates random permutations
   (simplest via Maxima), computes then (by our C++ program) the set of all
   prime implicates, computes basic measurements and puts it into a file,
   for evaluation by R. </li>
  </ul>
