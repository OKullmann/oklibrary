# Script which given an integer n and a 32-bit integer seed, computes a 
# random boolean function f : {0,1}^n -> {0,1}, and computes the statistics 
# for the boolean function.
#
# The statistics for the prime implicates and subsumption hypergraph for
# this boolean function are then computed and output to files.
#
# Files are output to 
#   random_bf_${e}_${seed}/Permutation_full.cnf
#     The CNF file for the generated permutation
#   random_bf_${e}_${seed}/Permutation_full.cnf_primes_stats
#     The prime implicate statistics for the generated CNF file.
#   random_bf_${e}_${seed}/Permutation_full.cnf_shg_stats
#     The subsumption hypergraph statistics for the generated CNF file.
#   random_bf_${e}_${seed}/maxima_log
#     The log of the maxima execution to generate the CNF file.
#
# This process continues picking random boolean functions until it is quit
# manually. The seed is incremented by one each iteration.
