  \brief Plans regarding SAT competitions


  \todo Update and completion of plans regarding SAT 2011
  <ul>
   <li> The SAT competitions are nearly finished now (except of the PB
   evaluation, which will be repeated). </li>
   <li> All results of the competition should be made available (in edited
   form, of course) on our benchmark sites. </li>
   <li> Also links to competition pages are needed there. </li>
   <li> Plus general comments and explanations. </li>
   <li> The successful solvers need to be installed. </li>
   <li> All todos need to be cleaned-up; most of them removed (possible
   with transfer to docus). </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Benchmarks for SAT 2011
  <ul>
   <li> DONE We should submit benchmarks for the SAT-2011-competition. </li>
   <li> DONE The deadline for:
    <ol>
     <li> SAT benchmark submission is Sunday 13th February 2011. </li>
     <li> PseudoBoolean registration is Wednesday 9th March 2011.
     </li>
     <li> PseudoBoolean benchmark submission is Sunday 20th March 2011. </li>
     <li> MaxSAT evaluation doesn't currently have any date specified. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE
   Likely only things where we have published something (to be cited).
   </li>
   <li> DONE
   So for this year it should be Green-Tao and van-der-Waerden instances.
   </li>
   <li> DONE And also AES-related instances are of interest. </li>
   <li> See "Prepare benchmarks for SAT 2011" in
   RamseyTheory/GreenTaoProblems/plans/general.hpp,
   RamseyTheory/VanderWaerdenProblems/plans/general.hpp,
   Cryptography/AdvancedEncryptionStandard/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> DONE Best in every series to have a mixture, from known to unknown
   instances, from not-too-hard to likely-very-hard. </li>
   <li> DONE For the formats see below. </li>
   <li> DONE For the categories see below. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Categories / "tracks" for SAT 2011
  <ul>
   <li> SAT competition:
    <ul>
     <li> <em>Random uniform k-SAT</em> instances where only generators are 
     allowed. </li>
     <li> <em>Applications</em> where instances of industrial and practical 
     interest are required. 
     </li>
     <li> <em>Crafted</em> where instances designed to be hard for SAT solvers,
     representing difficult puzzles, mathematical problems etc are required. 
     One should specify whether these instances are SAT or UNSAT. </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> PseudoBoolean competition:
    <ul>
     <li> Pseudo Boolean Satisfaction, <em>PBS</em>, which involves deciding 
     satisfiability for a set of PB constraints. </li>
     <li> Pseudo Boolean Optimisation, <em>PBO</em>, which involves finding a 
     model which optimises a given objective function. </li>
     <li> Weighted boolean optimisation, <em>WBO</em> where pseudo boolean 
     constraints have weights and then a solution must be
     found which minimises the sum of the weight of the falsified
     constraints. </li>
     <li> For PBS and PBO, there are the following categories:
      <ul>
       <li> DEC - pure decision problems, where the solver must only
       find a solution but there is no objective function, and no weights. 
       </li>
       <li> OPT - an objective function is present which must be 
       optimised but no weights are given to constraints. </li>
       <li> SOFT - all weights in the weighted boolean optimisation
       problem are "soft", i.e., one doesn't use the notion of a
       "hard" constraint which must be satisfied. </li>
       <li> PARTIAL - there is at least one "hard" weighted constraint
       in the weighted boolean optimisation problem, which must be 
       satisfied. </li>
      </ul>
      For each of these, there are the following sub-categories:
      <ul>
       <li> SMALLINT - the sum of the coefficients in any constraint is
       less than 2^21. </li>
       <li> BIGINT - the sum of the coefficients in at least one constraint
       is greater than or equal to 2^21. </li>
       <li> LIN - all constraints are linear. </li>
       <li> NCL - at least one constraint is non-linear. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> MaxSAT competition:
    <ul>
     <li> <em>Unweighted MaxSAT</em> where the benchmark is
     a standard Dimacs CNF and the solver tries to find an assignment
     which minimises the number of falsified clauses. </li>
     <li> <em>Partial MaxSAT</em> where the benchmark is a standard
     CNF file augmented with "hard" and "soft" indicators which are 
     added as prefixes to each clause, such that the solver must
     find an assignment which minimises the number of falsified
     clauses but satisifies all "hard" clauses. </li>
     <li> <em>Weighted MaxSAT</em> where each clause in the Dimacs
     file is prefixed with a positive integer weight and then the 
     solver must find an assignment which minimises the sum of the
     weights of the clauses falsified by the assignment. </li>
     <li> <em>Partial Weighted MaxSAT</em> where clauses are
     weighted as in weighted MaxSAT but there is a special "top" weight
     which can be used to denote "hard" clauses which must be satisfied
     as in partial MaxSAT. </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Formats for SAT 2011
  <ul>
   <li> The specifications of each of the formats can be found at:
   <ul>
    <li> SAT benchmarks - 
    http://www.satcompetition.org/2011/format-benchmarks2011.html . </li>
    <li> PseudoBoolean benchmarks - 
    http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/PB11/format.pdf . </li>
    <li> MaxSAT benchmarks - http://maxsat.ia.udl.cat/rules/ and
    http://maxsat.ia.udl.cat/requirements/ . </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
   <li> Further specific details about each format should be added to
   this todo. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo DONE (what we have now shall be enough)
  Supporting documents
  <ul>
   <li> For each class of instances, we need a README and PDF document
   explaining:
   <ol>
    <li> how they were generated </li>
    <li> their significance </li>
    <li> calculations for the various statistics for the clause-sets. </li>
   </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The PDF documents are best done in OKlib/annotations/, using the 
   prefix "SAT_2011_Benchmark_". </li>
  </ul>
