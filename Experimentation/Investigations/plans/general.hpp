  \brief Plans for the super-module for collecting data (not tools, but
  actual data)


  \todo Structure
  <ul>
   <li> Is the name "Investigations" right? </li>
   <li> Is the part Experimentation the right part? </li>
   <li> How shall we present the data? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Create milestones.


  \todo Rerun time-sensitive experiments
  <ul>
   <li> On older versions of the 32-bit linux-kernel, <= 2.6.35.6, there is
   bug which causes "user time" to be misreported as "system time" for CPU
   intensive processes which take more than ~40s. See
   https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16559 and
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=633037 . </li>
   <li> As most SAT solvers report the "user time" from the "getrusage"
   function in the GNU C libraries, this results in solvers reporting
   the wrong time duration for solving. </li>
   <li> This bug was evident and caused wrong solver times to be
   reported with some AES experiments; see commit
   dec0020519c4053f1b421e059d6bcb94ab753a67. </li>
   <li> Non-trivial experiments, where time is an important consideration
   should be rerun:
    <ul>
     <li> All in Cryptography/AdvancedEncryptionStandard/plans/SAT2011/. </li>
     <li> All in Cryptography/DataEncryptionStandard/plans/. </li>
     <li> This list must be expanded. </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> Safey measures:
    <ol>
     <li> Time sensitive experiments could always be run with the
     "time" shell command to ensure that the solver reports the correct
     time. </li>
     <li> However "time" itself is an arcane tool, which disturbs the programs
     it shall observe. </li>
     <li> See
     http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7056700/what-is-an-elegant-way-that-a-shell-script-times-itself-really/
     for some discussion and an alternative proposed by OK. </li>
     <li> So it seems best to only make probes, for new systems and new
     solvers, and also sporadically for all experiment series. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> We also need documentation on issues such as this, and "best practices"
   for experimentation. </li>
   <li> See also "Experiment scripts". </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Experiment scripts
  <ul>
   <li> We should provide docus containing a list of all experiment scripts
   used in the library. </li>
   <li> In this way, when creating new experiment scripts one knows where to
   look for examples. </li>
   <li> If the list is presented chronologically, one can also see the
   more recent examples of experiment scripts for more "up-to-date" practices.
   </li>
   <li> In such docus, there is also scope for discussion of best practices
   and requirements for experiment scripts (experiment directories, uniqueness
   of directory name via "date", reproducability etc) and how to achieve
   these. </li>
   <li> For now we have:

  </ul>


  \todo Sat-probability-approximations
  <ul>
   <li> Likely we should have a dedicated sub-module. </li>
   <li> Study the sequence of sat-probability-approximations (as computed by
   satprob_seqap in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Counting/InclusionExclusion.mac). </li>
   <li> Clearly strict upper and lower bounds alternate, until the final
   entry is correct. </li>
   <li> One could conjecture that the distance to the correct value first
   strictly increases, and then strictly decreases.
    <ol>
     <li> Verified with weak_php(m+1,m) for 0 <= m <= 3. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> Perhaps even stronger statements hold?!? </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Experimental investigations on heuristics
  <ul>
   <li> Above we have precise data on families of problem instances. </li>
   <li> Is now this supermodule also the right place for collecting
   data about computational experiments? </li>
   <li> Finally, a database is needed (like SatEx), and this should go
   somewhere else. </li>
   <li> Taking [Hooker, Vinay, 1995, Branching Rules for Satisfiability]
   as a starting point, we should completely update the data, using
   new heuristics and benchmarks (and also various evaluation techniques).
   But we should stay within the lookahead-paradigm, but perhaps generalised
   on the strength of reduction and look-ahead. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Add section on AES experiments to be run NEEDS UPDATE
  <ul>
   <li> Experiments need to be run on AES instances with different types
   of SAT algorithm (local search, dpll etc) to see how things stand
   with the AES translation (See 
   ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/Translations.hpp).
   </li>
   <li> Also experiments with the following need to be run :
    <ul>
     <li> Variants with less rounds. </li>
     <li> AES variants with different Sboxes. </li>
     <li> Analysis of good heuristics for AES (See "Experimental 
     investigations on heuristics") . </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Translations from CSP to SAT
  <ul>
   <li> For the order-encoding and variations, especially for arithmetical
   constraints, see [Tamura, Taga, Kitagawa, Banbara, Compiling finite linear
   {CSP} into {SAT}, Constraints, 2009, 14(2):254-272, doi =
   10.1007/s10601-008-9061-0Open Access]. </li>
   <li> There is also the "compact order encoding" by the same people. </li>
   <li> See also "Sugar" in
   Buildsystem/ExternalSources/SpecialBuilds/plans/CSP.hpp. </li>
