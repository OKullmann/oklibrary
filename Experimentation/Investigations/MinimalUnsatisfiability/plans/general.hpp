  \brief Plans regarding minimal unsatisfiable clause-sets


  \todo Connections
  <ul>
   <li> W.r.t. the classification of unsatisfiable hitting clause-sets see
   Experimentation/Investigations/UHittingCatalogue/plans/general.hpp. </li>
   <li> For the Maxima functions see
   Satisfiability/Lisp/MinimalUnsatisfiability/MinVarDegrees.mac
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Hitting proof systems
  <ul>
   <li> See Satisfiability/Lisp/ConflictCombinatorics/HittingProofSystem.mac
   for first implementations. </li>
   <li> Likely we should introduce a new submodule; perhaps at base level
   (i.e., one level up). </li>
   <li> Regarding stcs2hitref:
    <ol>
     <li> Can we extend it, so that it works with extended splitting trees?
     </li>
     <li> Can we characterise when tree hitting clause-sets are being
     produced? </li>
     <li> And can we always find, for appropriate splitting tree, the best
     hitting refutation? </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Understanding the recursion for non-Mersenne numbers
  <ul>
   <li> DONE (see [Kullmann Zhao, SAT 2011]
   How to prove that nonmersenne_rec[k] and
   nonmersenne_law(k) in
   Satisfiability/Lisp/MinimalUnsatisfiability/MinVarDegrees.mac
   are the same functions? </li>
   <li> Can we determine which i in the recursive formula
   nm(k) = max_{i in {2,...,k} min(2*i, nm(k-i+1)+i)
   are relevant?
    <ol>
     <li> Analysing the patterns:
     \verbatim
for k : 2 thru 70 do print(k, analyse_nonmersenne_rec(k));
