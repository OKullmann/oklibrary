  \brief On investigations into the Data Encryption Standard


  \todo Analysing the S-boxes
  <ul>
   <li> Most urgent is to use all our instruments to analyse the 8 S-boxes.
   </li>
   <li> Of course, starting with defining them at Maxima-level. </li>
   <li> Considering them as one 10-bit boolean function, or as 4 6-bit
   boolean functions. Likely better the first view, but we need to consider
   all possibilities. </li>
   <li> Determining the number of prime implicates, data on the subsumption
   hypergraph, and minimum CNFs, and r_0-,r_1-bases. </li>
   <li> Here also minimum DNF-representations are of interest! </li>
   <li> They can be used to yield pseudo-canonical translations. </li>
   <li> Analysis of the prime clauses:
    <ol>
     <li> Creating the CNF/DNF files:
     \verbatim
OKplatform> mkdir EXP_DES
OKplatform> cd EXP_DES/
EXP_DES> oklib --maxima

oklib_load("OKlib/ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/DataEncryptionStandard/Sboxes.mac");
for i : 1 thru 8 do (output_dessbox_fulldnf_stdname(i),output_dessbox_fullcnf_stdname(i));
     \endverbatim
     </li>
     <li> Prime-clause statistics:
     \verbatim
EXP_DES> for F in *.cnf; do QuineMcCluskeySubsumptionHypergraphFullStatistics-n16-O3-DNDEBUG ${F}; done

EXP_DES> for F in DES_Sbox_?_fullDNF.cnf_primes_stats; do cat ${F}; done

     </li>
     <li> All curves k -> nr (clause-length to number of occurrences) look
     like nice relatively symmetric curves. They have maximums around 30. 
     Some (1,2,4) look slightly concave and some look slightly convex
     (3,5,6,7,8). </li>
     <li> The DNF-output shows that no resolutions are possible, and thus these
     boolean functions have unique DNF. </li>
     <li> Quite some differences regarding the prime implicates. S-box number
     1 is the easiest, number 8 is the hardest. </li>
     <li> This is also confirmed by r_1-bases: Box 1 has an r_1-base with 126
     clauses, while for box 8 only one with 157 clauses was found. </li>
     <li> Also minimum representations need to be studied. </li>
     <li> As a model one can study random 6 x 4 boolean functions. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li> DONE These considerations need a dedicated sub-module. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Analysing the 6-to-1 bit Sbox functions
  <ul>
   <li> In general we consider each DES Sboxes as one whole 6-to-4 bit boolean
   function. </li>
   <li> However, the Sbox can be represented as 4 6-to-1 bit boolean
   functions. </li>
   <li> We should investigate the DNF and CNF representations, prime
   implicates, and so on, of these 6-to-1 bit representations. </li>
   <li> See bf2bfl in
   ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/FiniteFunctions/Basics.mac.
