#
# Goes through all combinations of AES translations and
# plaintext-ciphertext-pairs and runs all solvers on the combination of these
# instances.
#

# BUG: bad specification

# Takes eight arguments:
#
#   - The number (r) of rounds to run the experiment over.
#   - The number (k) of plaintext-ciphertext-pairs to generate per round.
#   - The number of columns (c) in the AES block (1-4).
#   - The number of rows (rw) in the AES block (1-4).
#   - The size (e) of the element field (4 or 8).
#   - Whether or not to use a special final round (fin_b) (true or false).
#   - The AES box translation to use (box_tran):
#       - aes_ts_box - The canonical translation for all boxes.
#       - aes_small_box - The smallest CNF translations for all boxes.
#       - aes_rbase_box - The smallest r_1 bases for each box.
#   - Which MixColumns translation to use (mc_tran):
#       - aes_mc_forward - Translating MixColumns in the forward direction.
#       - aes_mc_bidirectional - Translating MixColumns in the both directions.
#
# The script generates output files in the experiment directory (assumed to 
# have been created by generate_aes_experiment):
#
#  ssaes_r1-${r}_c${c}_rw${rw}_e${e}_f${fin_z}_k1-${k}_${box_tran}_${mc_tran}
#
# with the name 
#   
#   experiment_r${ri}_k${ki}.cnf_${solver_name}
#
# for each solver run, round, and plaintext-ciphertext-pair where ri ranges 
# from 1 to r, ki ranges from 1 to k and solver_name is the the name of the 
# SAT solver run in that instance. The contents of the file are simply the 
# full output of the corresponding solver on that parameter instance.
#
# All experiments are run at nice level 19 to avoid disturbing other processes.
#
# Dependencies:
#   This script depends on generate_aes_experiment yielding
#   files with names of the form ss_r${r}_* and 
#   ssaes_pcpair_r${r}_*_s${k}.cnf, and being in an experiment directory
#   with a name of the form 
#   ssaes_r1-${r}_c${c}_rw${rw}_e${e}_f${fin_z}_k1-${k} where fin_z is
#   1 if fin_b was true and 0 otherwise.
# 
# Assumptions:
#   This script assumes there is no file called "experiment.cnf" in
#   the experiment directory. If there is, this file will be overwritten
#   and then deleted.
#

# set -o errexit # Can't use as SAT solvers return non-zero.
