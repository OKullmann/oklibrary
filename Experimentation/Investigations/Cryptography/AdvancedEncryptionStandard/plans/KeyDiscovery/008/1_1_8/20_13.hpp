  \brief Investigations into small-scale AES key discovery with 1 row, 1 column and 8-bit field elements for 20 + 1/3 round AES


  \todo Problem specification
  <ul>
   <li> We investigate the 20 + 1/3 round small-scale AES with 1 row,
   1 column, using the 8-bit field size. </li>
   <li> We denote this AES instance by aes(20,1,1,8). </li>
   <li> aes(20,1,1,8) takes a 8-bit plaintext and 8-bit key and
   outputs a 8-bit ciphertext. </li>
   <li> For the full specification of this AES instance, see
   "Problem specification" in
   Cryptography/AdvancedEncryptionStandard/plans/KeyDiscovery/008/1_1_8/general.hpp.
   </li>
   <li> The decompositions and translations are listed in "Investigating
   dimensions" in
   Cryptography/AdvancedEncryptionStandard/plans/Experimentation.hpp.
   </li>
   <li> Note that we consider the canonical CNF translation, as
   this is an example of the "hardest" representation without
   new variables. See "Hardness of boolean function representations"
   in
   Experimentation/Investigations/BooleanFunctions/plans/general.hpp. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Using the canonical box translation
  <ul>
   <li> Translation of aes(20,1,1,8):
    <ul>
     <li> We treat S-boxes and additions as boxes. </li>
     <li> The S-box is considered as a 16x1 boolean function,
     translated using the canonical translation; see dualts_fcl in
     ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/FiniteFunctions/TseitinTranslation.mac.
     </li>
     <li> Additions of arity k are considered bit-wise as (k+1)-bit to 1-bit
     boolean functions; translated using their prime implicates. </li>
     <li> The MixColumns operation is the identity. </li>
     <li> Due to limitations in the translation, clauses occur in this
     translation representing equivalence of variables in the MixColumns;
     See "Remove hard-coding of multiplication by 01 in small-scale MixColumn"
     in
     ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/Translations.hpp.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> Translation of aes(20,1,1,8):
    <ul>
     <li> We treat S-boxes and additions as boxes. </li>
     <li> S-boxes are translated using the canonical translation;
     see dualts_fcl in
     ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/FiniteFunctions/TseitinTranslation.mac.
     </li>
     <li> Additions are translated using their prime implicates. </li>
     <li> The MixColumns operation is translated by translating both
     the MixColumns operation and its inverse. </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> Generating simplest small-scale AES for 20+1/3 rounds:

   <li> In this translation, we have:
    <ul>
     <li> 20 full rounds (Key Addition and SubBytes).
     </li>
     <li> 40 Sboxes:
      <ul>
       <li> 20 from SubBytes = 1 byte * 20 round; </li>
       <li> 20 from key schedule = 1 row * 1 byte * 20 round. </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> 648 additions:
      <ul>
       <li> 320 additions of arity 1:
        <ul>
         <li> 160 from forward MixColumns = 8 bits * 20 rounds; </li>
         <li> 160 from inverse MixColumns = 8 bits * 20 rounds. </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li> 328 additions of arity 2:
        <ul>
         <li> 160 from key additions = 8 bits * 20 rounds; </li>
         <li> 8 from final key addition = 8 bits; </li>
         <li> 160 from the key schedule = 8 bits * 20 rounds. </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li> 8 bits for the constant in the key schedule. </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> The number of clauses of each length in the canonical translation of
   the S-box:
   \verbatim
maxima> ncl_list_full_dualts(8,16);
[[2,4096],[17,256],[256,1]]
   \endverbatim
   </li>
   <li> This instance has the following number of clauses of length:
    <ul>
     <li> 1 : 160 = key schedule constant * 1; </li>
     <li> 2 : 164480 = 40 S-boxes * 4096 + 320 "additions" (arity 1) * 2;
     </li>
     <li> 3 : 1312 = 328 additions (arity 2) * 4; </li>
     <li> 17 : 10240 = 40 S-boxes * 256; </li>
     <li> 256 : 40 = 40 S-boxes * 1. </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li> Then we run experiments for AES instances with one round, up to
   those with twenty rounds, and inspect the results for round 20.
