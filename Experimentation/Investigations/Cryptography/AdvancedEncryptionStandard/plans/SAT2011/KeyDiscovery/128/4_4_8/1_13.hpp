  \brief Investigations into AES key discovery for one round AES (1+1/3)


  \todo Problem specification
  <ul>
   <li> In this file, we collect the investigations into translations of
   1 + 1/3 round small scale AES with four rows, four columns, using the 8-bit
   field size.
   </li>
   <li> Note that this is not the standard AES, as all rounds are the same;
   there is no special final round. </li>
   <li> The AES encryption scheme we model takes a 128-bit plaintext and
   128-bit key and outputs a 128-bit ciphertext. The plaintext, key and
   ciphertext are all considered, column by column, as 4x4 matrices of 8-bit
   elements.
   ??? what is the meaning of "we model" ??? are there several AES encryption
   schemes ???
   </li>
   <li> In other words, in the AES blocks (plaintext, key, ciphertext etc),
   the 8-bit element at position (i,j) in the matrix is the ((i-1)*4 + j)-th
   8-bit word of the 128-bits. </li>
   <li> The 8-bit element (b_0,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4,b_5,b_6,b_7) is considered as
   the polynomial b_0 * x^7 + b_1 * x^6 + b_2 * x^5 + b_4 * x^3 + b_5 * x^2 +
   b^6 * x + b_7. Addition and multiplication on these polynomials is defined
   as usual, modulo the polynomial x^8+x^4+x^3+x+1. </li>
   <li> The encryption scheme applies the following operations:
   <ol>
    <li> Addition of round key 0 (input key) to plaintext. </li>
    <li> Application of SubBytes (Sbox to each 8-bit element) operation. </li>
    <li> Application of linear diffusion operation. </li>
    <li> Addition of round key 1, resulting in the ciphertext. </li>
   </ol>
   </li>
   <li> The Sbox is non-linear permutation over the set of 8-bit elements,
   defined as inversion within the 8-bit field composed with an affine
   transformation.
   ??? One shouldn't have such general information at such low-level files:
   the parameters are important, and reminders about their meaning, but NOT
   such general information ???
   </li>
   <li> The linear diffusion operation applies a linear permutation to
   the input matrix, consisting of:
   <ol>
    <li> A shift of row i by i-1 to the left for all i from 1 to the number of
    rows. </li>
    <li> The AES MixColumns operation, which takes the input matrix and
    applies a matrix multiplication by the constant matrix
    \verbatim
maxima> ss_mixcolumns_matrix(2,8,4);
 matrix([x,x+1,1,1],[1,x,x+1,1],[1,1,x,x+1],[x+1,1,1,x])
    \endverbatim
    over the 8-bit field. As it is a matrix multiplication, this operation can
    be broken down into a "MixColumn" operation on each column of the input
    matrix.
    ??? Again, this general information is misplaced --- one wants to see
    clearly the general parameters (also information regarding complexity) ???
    </li>
   </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Using the canonical box translation
  <ul>
   <li> Translating the AES cipher treating Sboxes and field multiplications
   as whole boxes and translating these boxes using the canonical translation.
   </li>
   <li> Generating AES for 1 + 1/3 round:
   \verbatim
num_rounds : 1$
num_columns : 4$
num_rows : 4$
exp : 8$
final_round_b : false$
box_tran : aes_ts_box$
seed : 1$
mc_tran : aes_mc_bidirectional$
output_ss_fcl_std(num_rounds, num_columns, num_rows, exp, final_round_b, box_tran, mc_tran)$
