  \brief Investigations into AES related to the SAT 2011 paper

  The aim of these experiments is to investigate translations of the AES and 
  small scale AES cryptosystems using the translation scheme given in 
  ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/Translations.mac.

  The key aspects of the investigation are the representations for the 
  byte-function components of the AES (see 
  ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/SboxAnalysis.mac) and
  the translations of AES using these component translations into CNF.

  </ul>


  \todo Prepare benchmarks for SAT 2011
  <ul>
   <li> See "Benchmarks for SAT 2011" in
   Experimentation/Investigations/plans/SATCompetition.hpp. </li>
   <li> Other than the standard AES and small scale translations, the 
   minimisation problems for the AES boxes (Sbox and field multiplications) 
   should yield good benchmarks for weighted MaxSAT solvers. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Explain how to replace various AES boxes with identity or random
  boxes
  <ul>
   <li> As part of our investigations, we wish to make various parts of
   the AES sbox the identity, and then introduce the various boxes (Sbox,
   field multiplications etc), to determine which combinations of boxes
   "make AES difficult". </li>
   <li> To do this, we need to be able to generate AES translations which
   "make sense" (i.e. are permutations, given the key). </li>
   <li> These translations are possible with the current translation system
   without writing additional rewrite functions, however instructions
   and/or additional helper functions are necessary to make sure things
   easy to experiment with. </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Investigating conditions and their representations
  <ul>
   <li> A first central research question is how to choose appropriate
   representations of the conditions which altogether specify AES. </li>
   <li> More specifically, clause-sets representing the S-box and the
   various multiplications (with constants) are to be investigated upon
   their influence on SAT solving. </li>
   <li> See ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/Preprocessing/plans/general.hpp
   for the general perspective, where one starts from a CNF and derives
   DNFs from it by partitioning, while we have already given the DNFs (but
   not some original CNF). </li>
   <li> Studying the representations of the Sbox
    <ol>
     <li> See
     ComputerAlgebra/Cryptology/Lisp/Cryptanalysis/Rijndael/plans/SboxAnalysis.hpp.
     </li>
     <li> That module is not properly maintained: Actions for MG. </li>
     <li> See "r-based representations" in 
     Experimentation/Investigations/BooleanFunctions/plans/ReductionBasedRepresentations.hpp.
     </li>
     <li> A 0-based CNF-representation without additional variables is likely
     infeasible to use. </li>
     <li> Via dualts_fcl in
     ComputerAlgebra/Satisfiability/Lisp/FiniteFunctions/TseitinTranslation.mac
     we obtain a (totally) properly r_1-based representation of every box
     (see "Understanding dualts_fcl" in
     Lisp/FiniteFunctions/plans/TseitinTranslation.hpp). </li>
     <li> It seems most promising (for now) to consider here r=r_1 and r=r_2,
     applied to the sets of prime implicates of the various "boxes" involved.
     </li>
     <li> Perhaps actually the hitting-CNFs representing the Sbox might have
     values, since we have special algorithms. So other reductions than just
     the r_k-reductions are useful to consider in general. </li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ul>


  \todo Summary of previous experimental results
  <ul>
   <li> Before various improvements were made to the AES translation,
   experiments were run for 1-4 rounds translations of the AES
   and on the various boxes. </li>
   <li> A basic summary (even if not reproducible due to the new state of the
   system), should be made available here. </li>
  </ul>
