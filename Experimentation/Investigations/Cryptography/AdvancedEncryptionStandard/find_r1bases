#
# Given a full CNF in a Dimacs file, computes random r_1 bases for
# the given CNF file using RUcpGen and RUcpBase, randomly permuting and then
# sorting the input to RUcpGen in ascending order of clause length and randomly
# permuting and then sorting the input to RUcpBase in descending order of clause 
# length. 
#
# Optionally one may specify the initial seed into RandomShuffleDimacs used 
# to permute the clause-list given to RUcpGen and also
# the number of times t to call RUcpBase with a different seed per generating
# set which is generated (the RandomShuffleDimacs call to permute the input
# to RUcpBase is seeded with 1-t for each generating set).
#
# RBases are continually computed, increasing the seed each time by 1, and
# statistics for the r_1 bases generated printed out on STDOUT, along with
# the current minimum found (to avoid losing this information in a sea of
# text).
#
# Additionally the statistics for each r_1 base are available in 
#    
#    ${full_cnf_filename}_stats_gs${gen_seed}_bs_${base_seed}
#
# where ${gen_seed} is the current seed, and ${base_seed} is the current
# seed being passed to the RandomShuffleDimacs call leading into RUcpBase (1-t).
