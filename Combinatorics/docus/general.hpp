  \brief Main docus-file for the combinatorics part


  <h1> Combinatorics </h1>

  The part "Combinatorics of the OKlibrary contains all components regarding
  combinatorial problems, either supporting external sources, or delivering
  direct functionality (so for example a direct graph colouring algorithms
  would go here, while in part Applications we find components for solving
  colouring problems as applications of SAT).
